Bound and Teased
The cottage bedroom glowed with the soft amber of bedside lamps and a single low fire in the small hearth, casting long shadows that danced across the exposed stone walls and heavy wooden beams. Outside, the January night was still, frost etching patterns on the windowpanes, the world hushed except for the faint crackle of burning oak and the quickening breaths of the four inside.
David had prepared the space meticulously. Thick silk ropes—soft, black, and surprisingly strong—lay coiled on the nightstand beside a feather, a small vibrating wand, a bottle of chilled massage oil, and two blindfolds. The air carried the clean scent of cedar from the wood, mixed with the faint vanilla of Kelly's favorite lotion and the subtle musk of anticipation already rising from warm skin.
Kelly and Mandy stood at the foot of the bed, naked, their bodies illuminated in warm pools of light. Kelly's athletic runner's frame—long dark hair loose to her mid-back, toned limbs, fair skin with its light tan, 36B breasts rising and falling with quick breaths, smooth waxed mound leading to small delicate lips already flushed—radiated quiet confidence. Beside her, Mandy's petite five-foot form was a study in contrast: auburn waves framing her face, medium breasts full and soft, cute bubble butt curving invitingly, her green eyes wide with excited nervousness.
Liam leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, his twenty-eight-year-old muscular build mirroring his father's—dark hair cropped short, jeans slung low on his hips, cock already thickening visibly against the denim as he watched. David, forty-eight and imposing in nothing but loose black trousers, stepped forward, his salt-and-pepper hair catching the lamplight, strong calloused hands flexing.
"Tonight," David said, voice low and deliberate, "no rushing. No release until we decide. You two are ours to tease… to bind… to drive slowly, deliciously mad."
Kelly shivered visibly, nipples tightening to hard points in the cool air. Mandy bit her lower lip, thighs pressing together instinctively.
David moved first to Kelly. He took her wrists gently, guiding them behind her back. The silk rope was cool against her skin as he wound it with practiced care—figure-eight loops around her wrists, then a cinch that held firm but left no bite, the black cord crossing in elegant patterns against her fair skin. He tested the tension—enough to restrict, not enough to numb—then tied off with a secure knot. Her shoulders pulled back slightly, breasts thrusting forward, the position arching her spine in a way that made her breath catch.
"Comfortable?" he asked, voice soft but commanding.
"Yes, Daddy," she whispered, testing the bonds. The restriction sent a fresh wave of heat straight to her core—vulnerability laced with trust.
Liam stepped to Mandy next. He lifted her small arms above her head, crossing her wrists. The rope wound around them in careful coils, then he attached the long end to a sturdy ceiling hook David had installed weeks ago—high enough to stretch her petite frame onto her toes, her bubble butt flexing, breasts lifted invitingly. The position made her feel exposed, delicate, completely at their mercy.
Mandy's breathing quickened, green eyes darting between the men. "Please… don't be too mean."
Liam smirked, brushing a thumb across her nipple. "We won't hurt you, baby. But we will make you beg."
Both women now stood bound—Kelly's hands tied behind her, Mandy's arms stretched overhead. The vulnerability was palpable; every shift of hips, every shallow breath, amplified by the inability to cover or touch themselves. David picked up the feather first—a long, soft plume of black. He started with Kelly, trailing it slowly down the side of her neck, over her collarbone, circling one breast without touching the nipple. The sensation was maddening—light, barely-there, raising gooseflesh across her skin. She squirmed, the ropes holding her steady, forcing her to endure the tease.
"Stay still," he murmured, voice velvet over steel. The feather dipped lower, tracing the underside of her breasts, then down her ribs, circling her navel in lazy spirals. Kelly's thighs pressed together, a soft whimper escaping as the plume brushed the sensitive skin just above her mound—close, so close, but never quite where she needed.
Liam mirrored with Mandy, starting at her stretched arms, trailing the feather down the insides of her forearms, along the tender skin of her inner arms. She giggled involuntarily as it reached her armpits—light, ticklish, making her squirm against the ropes. The laughter quickly turned to breathy moans as he dragged it across the tops of her breasts, circling the areolas without touching the peaks. Her nipples strained, aching for contact; she arched, trying to bring them closer to the tormenting plume.
"Patience," Liam growled, voice rough with his own arousal. He trailed lower, over her stomach, along the flare of her hips, then down the insides of her thighs—teasingly close to her core but never touching. Mandy's hips rocked forward instinctively, seeking friction that never came.
The men switched tools. David retrieved the chilled massage oil—pouring a thin stream directly onto Kelly's breasts. The cold made her gasp, nipples tightening further as the oil trickled down her stomach in cool rivulets. He warmed it between his palms, then began slow, slippery strokes—massaging her breasts with deliberate care, thumbs circling the nipples without direct contact, palms sliding over the slick skin in long glides that made her arch into his touch. The oil made every sensation amplified—cool at first, then warming with friction, her breasts heavy and sensitive under his hands.
Liam did the same to Mandy—oil dripping onto her stretched form, running in rivulets down her ribs, pooling at her navel. His hands followed, massaging her sides, thumbs brushing the undersides of her breasts, then finally—finally—cupping them fully, rolling her nipples between oiled fingers. The sensation was exquisite: slippery, warm pressure that made her moan openly, hips rolling in helpless need.
The vibrator came next—small, powerful, with a soft silicone head. David pressed it lightly against Kelly's mound—above her clit, the vibrations traveling through the sensitive flesh without direct contact. The tease was torture; she bucked, trying to bring her clit to the source, but the ropes and his steady hand kept her just shy of relief. The buzz hummed through her core, building pressure like a slow-rising tide, her pussy clenching on nothing, wetness trickling down her thighs.
Liam mirrored with Mandy—vibrator circling her inner thighs, brushing the outer lips of her pussy, then pressing against the raised mound without touching her clit. Her petite body trembled on tiptoes, arms straining against the ropes overhead, breasts heaving with each shallow breath. "Please… please touch me there," she begged, voice high and desperate.
"Not yet," David said calmly, turning up the intensity on Kelly's vibrator. The stronger buzz sent shockwaves through her, her knees buckling slightly. She was dripping now—slickness coating her inner thighs, the scent of her arousal thick in the room.
They edged them mercilessly—vibrator on, then off; feather returning to trace wet trails of oil; fingers ghosting over clits without pressure. Kelly's moans turned to whimpers, her body trembling with denied need. Mandy's pleas grew incoherent—small, desperate sounds as her bubble butt flexed, trying to grind against air.
Finally, after what felt like hours of exquisite torture, David spoke. "Come for us," he commanded, pressing the vibrator directly to Kelly's clit on high.
The orgasm hit like lightning—body seizing, walls contracting in powerful waves, release flooding down her thighs in hot pulses. She cried out, knees buckling, ropes holding her upright as pleasure ripped through her.
Liam did the same to Mandy—vibrator firm against her swollen clit. Her small frame convulsed, arms straining overhead, a high keen tearing from her throat as she shattered—waves crashing through her, pussy clenching on nothing, wetness dripping onto the floor.
They untied the women gently—wrists rubbed, shoulders massaged, blindfolds removed. Kelly and Mandy collapsed into the men's arms, trembling with aftershocks, skin flushed and sensitive.
But the night was far from over.
David carried Kelly to the bed, laying her on her back. Liam did the same with Mandy. The men shed the last of their clothes, cocks thick and ready. They entered slowly—David into Kelly, Liam into Mandy—deep, claiming thrusts that built on the lingering sensitivity.
The teasing had heightened every nerve; each stroke felt magnified, the women writhing beneath them, begging for more.
They fucked them thoroughly—positions shifting: missionary, then doggy, then the women riding while the men held their wrists lightly above their heads.
Climaxes rolled again and again—each one more intense than the last, bodies slick with sweat and oil, the room filled with the symphony of skin on skin, wet sounds, and broken moans.
When dawn crept through the curtains, they lay in a tangled, sated heap—ropes discarded, feathers forgotten, bodies marked only by love bites and the sweet ache of overused muscles.
The bondage and teasing had pushed them deeper into trust, deeper into desire.
