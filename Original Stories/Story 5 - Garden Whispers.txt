Garden Whispers
The family visit to Sheffield had been pleasant enough—Sunday roast with aunts and uncles, laughter echoing through the modest semi-detached house on a quiet cul-de-sac. Kelly’s two older brothers, Mark and Liam, had sunk deep into the living room sofa after dinner, beers in hand, eyes glued to the football match on the big screen. Cheers and groans filled the air every time the ball hit the post or a foul was called. The noise was constant, rowdy, and perfect cover.
Kelly caught David’s eye across the room during a particularly loud goal celebration. She tilted her head subtly toward the back door. He nodded once, casual, then excused himself a minute later with a murmur about needing some air.
Outside, the night was crisp and clear, the late January chill biting at exposed skin. The garden stretched long and narrow behind the house—typical English suburban plot with a patchy lawn, a few raised flower beds dormant for winter, fairy lights strung along the fence giving a soft golden glow, and at the far end, an old trampoline the boys had bought years ago for their nieces and nephews.
Kelly led the way down the garden path, breath fogging in the cold. She wore jeans and a thick jumper, but the chill made her nipples tighten against her bra. David followed close, hands in his pockets, watching the sway of her hips.
At the trampoline, she climbed on first, the springs creaking softly under her weight. She sat cross-legged in the center, patting the mat beside her. David joined her, the surface dipping and bouncing gently as he settled. The fairy lights were distant enough that moonlight took over, silvering everything—their faces, the grass, the faint outline of the house far up the garden.
“Feels like we’re miles away,” Kelly whispered, leaning back on her hands. “Even with all that noise inside.”
David shifted closer, thigh pressing against hers. “They won’t notice us gone for a bit. Match is in full swing.”
She turned to him, eyes dark and glittering in the moonlight. “Good.” Her voice dropped lower. “Because I’ve been thinking about you all evening, Daddy. Watching you across the table… pretending everything’s normal.”
His hand found her knee, squeezing gently. “You’ve been driving me crazy, love. That little smile you gave me when Liam passed the potatoes.”
Kelly laughed softly, then leaned in. Their lips met—slow, exploratory at first, tasting the faint trace of red wine from dinner. The kiss deepened quickly, tongues sliding, breaths mingling in white clouds. His hand slid up her thigh, fingers tracing the seam of her jeans.
She pulled back just enough to whisper, “Lie back.”
David obeyed, stretching out on the mat. The trampoline bounced lightly as Kelly straddled him, knees on either side of his hips. She ground down slowly, feeling him harden beneath her. The springs creaked rhythmically with each subtle roll of her hips.
Inside the house, a roar went up—goal scored. The sound carried faintly, reminding them how close the rest of the family was.
Kelly’s jumper came off first, then her bra. Moonlight painted her breasts pale, nipples dark and peaked from cold and arousal. David’s hands rose to cup them, thumbs circling the hard buds. He felt their weight shift as she moved, soft and warm against his palms despite the chill air.
“Quiet,” she breathed, though her own moan slipped out when he pinched lightly.
She worked his belt open, jeans down just enough to free him. His cock stood thick and flushed in the moonlight, pre-cum glistening at the tip. Kelly stroked him slowly, then leaned down to take him into her mouth—warm, wet suction that made him groan low in his throat. She swirled her tongue around the head, tasting salt and skin, then took him deeper, cheeks hollowing.
David’s hand tangled gently in her hair, guiding without forcing. The trampoline swayed with her movements, springs singing softly.
When he was close, she pulled off with a wet pop, climbing higher. She shimmied out of her jeans and knickers in one awkward, hurried motion, then positioned herself above him. She rubbed her slick folds along his length—coating him in her arousal, the wet glide audible even over the distant TV cheers.
“Need you inside me,” she whispered.
She sank down slowly, enveloping him in exquisite heat. The stretch drew a shared gasp. She began to ride—gentle at first, savoring every inch, then deeper, faster. The trampoline amplified each motion—bouncing her lightly, making her breasts sway hypnotically. David’s hands gripped her hips, helping her find rhythm, eyes locked on where their bodies joined: his thick shaft disappearing into her smooth, flushed entrance, glistening in the moonlight.
A sudden cheer from the house made them freeze—both laughing breathlessly at the risk.
Kelly leaned forward, changing the angle, grinding her clit against his pubic bone. Her movements grew wilder—hips circling, bouncing, chasing pleasure. David thrust up to meet her, the springs creaking louder now, but the football roar covered it.
She came first—body trembling, inner walls fluttering around him in rhythmic pulses. The sight and feel pushed him over. He thrust deep one last time, spilling inside her with a stifled groan, hot release flooding her.
They stayed joined, breathing hard, foreheads pressed together. The trampoline settled slowly beneath them.
After a minute, Kelly lifted off carefully, a soft wet sound accompanying the separation. She curled into his side, head on his chest, his arm around her shoulders. Moonlight washed over them, turning sweat-slick skin to silver.
“Think they noticed?” she murmured.
David kissed her temple. “Not a chance. They’re too busy arguing about penalties.”
They lay there a while longer, wrapped in each other, listening to the faint muffled commentary from the house. Eventually they dressed—clothes cold against warm skin—then walked back up the garden hand-in-hand, slipping inside like nothing had happened.
Mark glanced up from the sofa as they entered. “Where’d you two disappear to?”
Kelly smiled sweetly. “Just getting some air. It’s a nice night.”
David nodded, casual. “Yeah. Fresh air does wonders.”
They took their seats again, thighs brushing under the coffee table, secret smiles shared across the room while the match played on.
