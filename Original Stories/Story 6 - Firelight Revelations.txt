Firelight Revelations
The cottage felt quieter without David— he'd been called away to help a cousin with a roofing job in Cardiff, promising to be back late the following evening. Kelly had invited Mandy over for what was meant to be a simple catch-up. Mandy—her ex-sister-in-law, still very much her friend despite the messy breakup with Kelly's brother two years earlier—had driven up from Bristol with a bottle of Rioja and a mischievous grin.
Mandy was tiny, barely five feet tall, but she carried herself with effortless confidence. Her body was a perfect miniature hourglass: medium breasts that filled out her soft sweater beautifully, a narrow waist, and a cute, round bubble butt that swayed when she walked. Dark auburn hair fell in loose waves to her shoulders, and her green eyes sparkled with the same playful energy Kelly remembered from years of shared secrets.
They'd started on the sofa with wine and gossip, the fire crackling in the hearth, fairy lights twinkling along the mantel. Two bottles in, the conversation had softened, grown intimate. Mandy kicked off her boots and tucked her legs under her, leaning closer.
"You've been glowing lately," Mandy said, tilting her head. "Like, properly radiant. New man?"
Kelly laughed softly, cheeks warming from more than the wine. "Something like that."
Mandy's eyes narrowed playfully. "Come on. Spill. Who's making you smile like that? Is he good? Does he know how to… take care of you?"
The question hung between them, heavy with implication. Kelly met Mandy's gaze, the firelight dancing in both their eyes. "He's… incredible. Protective. Dominant in the best way. Makes me feel completely seen."
Mandy bit her lip, shifting closer. "God, that sounds hot. I haven't had that in ages. Liam was… well, you know." She paused, then added quietly, "Sometimes I wonder what it would be like with someone who really knows how to touch a woman."
The air shifted. Kelly felt the familiar heat coil low in her belly. She reached out, brushing a strand of auburn hair from Mandy's face. "Maybe you don't have to wonder."
Mandy's breath caught. Their faces were inches apart now. Then Mandy closed the distance, kissing Kelly softly at first—testing—then deeper, tongues meeting in a slow, exploratory dance. Wine and warmth and want.
Clothes came off in a quiet flurry. Mandy's sweater lifted over her head, revealing full, soft breasts with dusky nipples already tight. Kelly's top followed, then jeans and knickers. They tumbled to the thick rug in front of the fire, skin glowing in the amber light.
Mandy ended up on top, straddling Kelly's face in a perfect 69. Kelly's tongue traced Mandy's delicate folds—sweet, slick, a little tangy from arousal. Mandy moaned against Kelly's pussy, lapping eagerly, small hands gripping Kelly's thighs. Their bodies moved in rhythm: soft gasps, wet sounds, the fire popping in time with their pleasure.
Neither heard the front door open quietly.
David had finished early and driven back through the night, intending to surprise them. He froze in the doorway, keys still in hand.
In the firelight, two beautiful women tangled on the rug: Kelly beneath, long dark hair fanned out, Mandy's petite frame arched above her, bubble butt raised, head buried between Kelly's legs. The sight was devastating—soft curves, glistening skin, the unmistakable sounds of mutual devotion.
He watched, silent, cock hardening painfully against his jeans. The way Mandy's small breasts swayed with each movement, the way Kelly's fingers dug into Mandy's ass, guiding her hips… it was hypnotic. Then Kelly's eyes fluttered open. She saw him in the shadows. A slow, wicked smile curved her lips. Without breaking rhythm, she lifted one hand and crooked a finger—come here.
David stepped forward quietly. Mandy was too lost in pleasure to notice at first. Kelly kept her tongue working, then gently guided Mandy's hips higher. David knelt behind Mandy, hands smoothing over her round ass—small, firm, perfect in his palms. He leaned in, inhaling her scent—musky, feminine, different from Kelly's but intoxicating.
Mandy gasped when she felt the new presence, a larger body behind her. She started to turn, but Kelly's hands on her hips held her steady. "Shh… trust me," Kelly whispered.
David's fingers traced Mandy's entrance—already dripping from Kelly's attention. He pressed two fingers inside her slowly, marveling at how tight she was, how her walls fluttered around him despite her arousal. Mandy moaned louder, pushing back instinctively.
Kelly smiled up at David over Mandy's shoulder. "She's so small, Daddy. Be gentle."
He undressed quickly, cock thick and heavy. He coated himself in Mandy's wetness, then pressed the head against her entrance. Mandy whimpered, then sighed as he eased in—slow, careful inches. She was incredibly tight, gripping him like a fist, hot and slick. He paused often, letting her adjust, stroking her back, murmuring soft praise.
When he was fully seated, Mandy trembled, overwhelmed by the stretch. David began to move—shallow, gentle thrusts that gradually deepened. Mandy's moans turned desperate, muffled against Kelly's pussy as she licked harder, chasing her own release.
Kelly came first—back arching, thighs clamping around Mandy's head, a soft cry swallowed by the fire's crackle. The sight pushed Mandy over the edge—her small body shaking, walls pulsing around David in rhythmic waves.
David pulled out carefully, still hard. He lay back on the rug. Mandy, flushed and trembling, straddled him without hesitation, sinking down onto his cock with a long, blissful sigh. She was so petite that he filled her completely, the visual almost obscene—her bubble butt bouncing as she rode him, breasts swaying.
Kelly swung a leg over David's face, lowering herself until his tongue met her still-sensitive folds. He licked her eagerly, tasting her release while Mandy rode him harder, small hands braced on his chest.
The two women leaned forward, meeting in a deep, hungry kiss—tongues tangling, sharing the taste of each other. Mandy's hips moved faster, grinding down, taking him to the hilt. Kelly rocked against David's mouth, chasing a second peak.
Mandy came again—sharp, shuddering, walls clamping down so tightly David couldn't hold back. He thrust up once, twice, then spilled inside her with a low groan, filling her completely.
Kelly followed moments later, grinding against his tongue, body trembling.
They collapsed in a warm, tangled heap—David in the middle, Mandy curled against his side, Kelly draped half over him, head on his chest. The fire crackled softly. Wine glasses sat forgotten on the coffee table.
Mandy lifted her head after a while, looking between them with wide, dazed eyes. "That… was unexpected."
Kelly laughed breathlessly, kissing her shoulder. "Good unexpected?"
Mandy smiled shyly, then looked at David. "Very good."
David stroked Mandy's back, then reached for Kelly's hand. "Welcome to the family secret, Mandy."
She nestled closer, content. "I think I could get used to this."
Outside, the night was still. Inside, the fire burned low, and three bodies glowed in its dying light—sated, tangled, and perfectly at peace.
