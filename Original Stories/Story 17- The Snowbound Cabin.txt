The Snowbound Cabin
The narrow road to the Snowdonia cabin had been a white tunnel of falling snow, the Land Rover's headlights carving through swirling flakes as David navigated the final mile. By the time they reached the secluded timber lodge perched on a forested slope, the world outside had been reduced to soft, muffled silence—only the crunch of tires on fresh powder and the low hum of the engine. The cabin was perfect isolation: dark cedar walls, wide windows overlooking a frozen lake half-hidden by pines, and a private hot tub steaming on the wraparound deck, already lit and waiting.
Inside, the air smelled of pine resin, woodsmoke, and the faint vanilla of the candles Kelly had lit earlier. A massive stone fireplace dominated the living room, logs already crackling, throwing golden light across thick wool rugs and a deep leather sofa. The four of them—David, Kelly, Mandy, and Liam—shed coats and boots in the entryway, snowflakes melting on wool and denim, leaving dark spots on the floorboards.
Kelly was first to the window, pressing her palms to the cold glass. Her long dark hair hung loose, still slightly damp from the drive, framing her face in soft waves. She wore thick wool socks and one of David's oversized flannel shirts, sleeves rolled up, the hem brushing her thighs. The firelight caught the light tan on her legs, the subtle curve of her calves from endless trail runs. She turned, hazel eyes bright.
"It's like we're the only people in the world."
David came up behind her, strong arms encircling her waist. At forty-eight he still moved with the quiet power of a man who worked with his hands—broad shoulders, calloused palms sliding under the flannel to rest warm against her bare stomach. He pressed his lips to the side of her neck, tasting the faint salt of her skin mixed with the clean scent of snow. "That's the point, baby girl," he murmured, voice low and gravelly. "No one to hear. No one to see."
Mandy padded over in fuzzy slippers and an oversized sweater that swallowed her petite five-foot frame, auburn waves tumbling loose. Her medium breasts shifted softly beneath the knit, nipples faintly visible as peaks against the wool. She carried two glasses of deep red wine, passing one to Kelly, then leaning against Liam's chest. At twenty-eight he was a younger echo of his father—tall, muscular, dark hair still dusted with melting snowflakes. His hand settled possessively on Mandy's hip, thumb tracing slow circles over the sweater's hem.
Liam took a slow sip of his own wine, eyes tracing the curve of Mandy's bubble butt as she leaned into him. "Hot tub first?" he asked, voice rough with the same quiet hunger that had simmered since the forest clearing, since the barn, since every stolen moment since.
They drank in the living room for a while, sprawled on the rug in front of the fire. Wine warmed their blood, loosened tongues and limbs. Kelly sat between David's legs, back to his chest, his arms wrapped around her. Every so often his hand would drift under the flannel—fingers tracing lazy patterns over her stomach, brushing the underside of her breasts, never quite reaching the nipples that ached for attention. The tease was slow, deliberate; she felt herself grow slick between her thighs, the heat pooling low and insistent.
Mandy curled sideways on the sofa, head in Liam's lap. His fingers combed through her auburn hair, occasionally drifting down to stroke the side of her breast through the sweater, thumb grazing the soft swell, circling the nipple without direct pressure. She sighed, thighs pressing together, the gentle friction sending tiny sparks through her core.
Outside, snow continued to fall—thick, silent, blanketing the world in white hush.
Eventually they migrated to the deck. The hot tub steamed in the cold air, bubbles churning softly, the scent of chlorine faint beneath the crisp pine and snow. They stripped without ceremony—clothes left in a careless pile on the deck boards. Naked bodies glowed in the blue underwater lights and the warm spill from the cabin windows.
Kelly stepped in first, sighing as the heat enveloped her calves, then thighs, then waist. The water was almost too hot against her chilled skin, a delicious contrast that made her nipples tighten to sharp points. She sank down until only her shoulders and head remained above the surface, long hair floating like dark silk.
David followed, the water parting around his powerful frame. He settled behind her, pulling her back against his chest. His cock, already half-hard, nestled against the small of her back—thick, warm, a promise. His hands roamed under the water—cupping her breasts, thumbs circling the nipples in slow, slippery strokes. The sensation was exquisite: warm water, warm hands, the gentle tug and roll that sent jolts straight to her clit.
Mandy slipped in next, petite body disappearing to the shoulders in one smooth motion. She floated toward Liam, who waited at the opposite side. He caught her waist, pulling her close until she straddled his lap. Her bubble butt settled against his thighs, his erection pressing up between them—hot and insistent. Mandy wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him slowly—lips parting, tongues sliding in lazy exploration. The kiss tasted of wine and winter air.
Liam's hands roamed her back, then lower, cupping her ass, fingers spreading the cheeks slightly under the water. He lifted her just enough to align himself, then guided her down—slow, deliberate. The stretch was intense; her extreme tightness yielded inch by inch, walls fluttering around his girth. Mandy's head fell back, a soft moan escaping into the snowy night as she took him fully, the heat of the water and his body merging into one overwhelming sensation.
They moved together—gentle rolls of hips beneath the surface, water lapping at their skin, steam rising in soft clouds. Mandy's breasts floated slightly, nipples breaking the surface like dark pearls, Liam's mouth finding one, sucking gently, tongue flicking the peak in time with his thrusts.
Across the tub, Kelly turned in David's arms, straddling him now. She guided him inside her—slow descent, savoring the stretch, the way he filled her completely. The angle let him hit deep, brushing that sensitive front wall with every subtle rock of her hips. David's hands gripped her waist, guiding her rhythm—slow, languid circles that made the water ripple outward in soft waves.
The night stretched—gentle, unhurried. They swapped partners once, twice—Kelly riding Liam while Mandy took David, then back again. Touches lingered: fingers tracing spines, lips brushing necks, hands cupping breasts and asses with reverent slowness. Orgasms built like slow-rising tides—quiet gasps, trembling thighs, soft cries swallowed by the falling snow.
Later, wrapped in thick robes, they moved inside to the rug in front of the fire. Wine glasses refilled, bodies still flushed and sensitive. Kelly lay back, head in David's lap, while Mandy curled against Liam's side. Fingers wandered lazily—tracing collarbones, circling nipples, dipping between thighs without urgency.
They made love again on the rug—slow, face-to-face, eye contact unbroken. David entered Kelly missionary-style, deep and measured, her legs wrapped around him, heels digging into his back. Mandy rode Liam beside them, small hands braced on his chest, hips rolling in tight, sensual circles.
Climaxes came like soft waves—rippling through them, bodies trembling, soft moans mingling with the fire's crackle. No rush, no force—just deep, connected pleasure that left them breathless and sated. They slept in a pile on the oversized bed—limbs tangled, skin warm, the snow outside continuing its silent fall. The cabin held them close, the world beyond forgotten.


The morning after their first night in the Snowdonia cabin dawned crystalline and still. Fresh snow had fallen overnight, blanketing the world in pristine white silence. The sky was a pale, icy blue, the sun just cresting the ridge, sending long shafts of golden light through the pines. Inside the cabin, the fire had burned to glowing embers, leaving the air warm and scented with woodsmoke.
David woke first, as always. He lay in the center of the oversized bed, Kelly curled against his left side—her long dark hair spilling across his chest, one toned leg draped over his thigh, her breathing slow and even. Mandy nestled on his right, petite frame tucked under his arm, auburn waves tickling his shoulder, her soft breasts pressed warmly against his ribs. Liam sprawled at the foot, one arm thrown possessively over Mandy's waist.
The quiet was profound—only the occasional creak of settling logs and the distant call of a raven breaking the hush. David felt the deep contentment of possession: these three bodies, warm and trusting against his, bound to him by secrets and shared desire. He traced lazy circles on Kelly's bare back with his fingertips, feeling the subtle rise and fall of her breath, the silk of her skin still faintly scented with last night's bath oil.
Kelly stirred first, hazel eyes fluttering open. She smiled sleepily, pressing a soft kiss to his collarbone. "Morning, Daddy."
"Morning, baby girl." His voice was low, rough with sleep. He tilted her chin up for a slow kiss—lips brushing, parting, tongues meeting in gentle exploration that tasted of shared breath and lingering wine.
Mandy murmured, stretching like a cat, small hands sliding down David's stomach. "Mmm… too early." But her fingers wandered lower, brushing his morning hardness with teasing lightness.
Liam woke to the movement, dark eyes opening to find Mandy's hand on his father's cock. He grinned, reaching over to cup one of her medium breasts, thumb circling the nipple until it pebbled. "Not too early for this."
They lingered in bed a while longer—slow, lazy touches building heat without urgency. Kelly's hand joined Mandy's, stroking David together in unhurried rhythm. Liam kissed Mandy's neck, fingers dipping between her thighs to find her already slick. Soft sighs filled the room, bodies shifting in gentle rhythm, until the need for coffee and fresh air won out.
They dressed warmly: thermal layers, wool socks, heavy boots, thick coats, scarves, and beanies. Kelly in dark leggings and a fitted jacket that hugged her athletic curves; Mandy in snow pants and a puffy coat that made her look even smaller; Liam and David in rugged outdoor gear, packs slung over shoulders with water, snacks, and a small blanket.
The hike began right from the deck—down a narrow path through snow-laden pines. The air was sharp and clean, biting at cheeks and noses, carrying the scent of frozen earth and evergreen. Snow crunched under boots, powder soft and deep. Each breath fogged white; the world felt hushed, intimate, as if the mountains themselves were holding their breath.
They walked single file at first—David leading, breaking trail, his broad shoulders parting the drifts. Kelly followed, marveling at the way sunlight filtered through branches, turning snow crystals into diamonds. Mandy came next, small steps quick and eager, occasionally reaching back to take Liam's gloved hand. Liam brought up the rear, eyes tracing the sway of Mandy's bubble butt in her snow pants, the swing of Kelly's ponytail.
After twenty minutes the trail opened into a small clearing—a frozen pond ringed by pines, the surface a perfect mirror of sky and snow-laden branches. Sunlight poured in, warming the tops of their heads despite the chill. They stopped, breathing hard, cheeks flushed pink.
Kelly turned to David, eyes bright. "It's beautiful."
He pulled her close, arms wrapping around her waist. "You're beautiful," he murmured, tilting her chin up for a kiss—slow, deep, tongues sliding in the crisp air. The cold made their lips tingle; the warmth of the kiss spread through them like liquid fire.
Mandy watched, smiling, then tugged Liam down for her own kiss—smaller, softer, but no less hungry. His large hands cupped her face, thumbs brushing her cold-reddened cheeks.
They spread the blanket on a flat rock near the pond's edge—snow brushed away, wool insulating against the cold stone. Wine from a thermos, cheese and bread from the pack. They ate slowly, sharing bites, fingers brushing lips, wine warming bellies and loosening inhibitions.
The cold air sharpened every sensation. When David pulled Kelly onto his lap, facing him, her coat open, his hands slid under layers to cup her breasts—thumbs circling nipples through thin thermals. She rocked gently against his hardness, the friction muted by clothes but electric nonetheless.
Mandy straddled Liam the same way—small hands on his shoulders, grinding slow circles, feeling him thicken beneath her. Their kisses grew deeper, breaths fogging between them.
Clothes came off in careful stages—coats unzipped, layers peeled, bare skin exposed to the biting air only long enough to send shivers of pleasure-pain before pressing back together for warmth. David's mouth found Kelly's breast, sucking the cold-tightened nipple into heat, tongue swirling until she arched with a soft cry that echoed across the frozen pond.
Liam lifted Mandy's sweater, kissing down her stomach—tasting the faint salt of skin chilled by the air, then warmer as he reached her core. She parted her thighs, small hands in his hair, moaning as his tongue traced her delicate lips, delving into her slick heat.
They made love on the blanket—slow, face-to-face, bodies rocking in gentle rhythm. David entered Kelly missionary-style, the angle deep and intimate, her legs wrapped around him, heels digging into his back through layers. The cold air kissed exposed skin; the heat of their joining contrasted sharply, every thrust amplified by the chill.
Mandy rode Liam—small body rising and falling, breasts bouncing softly, her bubble butt flexing with each drop. He gripped her hips, guiding her, eyes locked on hers.
Orgasms built quietly—soft gasps, trembling thighs, quiet cries swallowed by the snow. When they came it was like waves meeting shore—rippling through them, bodies clenching, warmth flooding in the cold.
Afterward they dressed slowly, sharing wine, laughing softly at the absurdity and perfection of it all. The hike back was slower—hands linked, bodies brushing, the snow sparkling around them like diamonds.
Back at the cabin, the hot tub waited—steam rising into the falling dusk. They sank in naked, wine glasses balanced on the edge, bodies pressing close under the water.
The night unfolded in gentle waves—kisses, touches, slow lovemaking under the stars, snow falling softly around them.
The cabin held them, the mountains watched, and time itself seemed to pause.
