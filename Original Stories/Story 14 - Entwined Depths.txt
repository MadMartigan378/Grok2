Entwined Depths
The cottage kitchen hummed with the remnants of breakfast— the scent of fresh coffee lingering in the air, mingling with the faint, earthy aroma of toast and jam. Sunlight streamed through the windows, casting warm golden pools on the wooden table where Mandy perched on the edge, her petite five-foot frame dangling her legs playfully. She wore nothing but one of David's oversized shirts, the fabric riding up her thighs to reveal the smooth, fair skin of her inner legs. Her auburn hair cascaded in loose waves over her shoulders, framing her green eyes that sparkled with a mix of mischief and lingering tipsiness from the wine they'd shared the night before. At her core, a subtle ache remained from the previous evening's explorations— a delicious reminder of how David's thick length had claimed her, stretching her extreme tightness in ways that left her craving more.
David stood before her, his muscular forty-eight-year-old body clad only in loose boxers that did little to hide the growing bulge beneath. His salt-and-pepper hair was tousled from sleep, and his strong, calloused hands—hands that had built fences and roofs over the years—now reached out to trace the hem of the shirt, lifting it slowly to expose her medium breasts, the dusky nipples already hardening under his gaze. The weight of them shifted slightly as she breathed, full and perky, begging for attention. "You look like trouble this morning," he murmured, voice gravelly with morning huskiness, leaning in to capture her lips in a deep, unhurried kiss. Their tongues met, dancing slowly, tasting the faint sweetness of jam from breakfast and the underlying heat of desire that had simmered since Liam's arrival and integration into their secret world.
Mandy moaned into the kiss, her small hands sliding up his broad chest, feeling the coarse hair dusted across his pecs, the steady thud of his heart beneath. The taboo thrill of it all—being here with her ex's father, after the heated confessions and the way Liam had joined them last night—sent a fresh wave of arousal pooling between her legs. Her cute bubble butt clenched against the table's edge, and she parted her thighs instinctively, inviting him closer.
David's hands roamed lower, cupping her breasts first—thumbs circling the nipples in firm, teasing strokes that made them ache with sensitivity. The texture was exquisite: soft skin yielding under his rough palms, the peaks stiffening like ripe berries under his touch. He broke the kiss to trail his mouth down her neck, nipping at the pulse point where her heartbeat fluttered wildly, tasting the faint salt of her skin warmed by the sun. "Spread for me, little one," he commanded softly, his dominant side emerging in that protective, loving tone that made her melt.
Mandy obeyed, her legs parting wider, the shirt hiking up to reveal her smooth, waxed mound—raised slightly, leading to small, delicate lips already flushed pink and glistening with arousal. The scent of her wafted up—musky and sweet, a feminine invitation that made David's cock twitch harder against his boxers. He dropped to his knees, strong hands gripping her thighs, spreading them further. The table's edge dug into her ass cheeks, a slight discomfort that only heightened the anticipation.
His breath ghosted over her core first, warm and teasing, making her shiver. Then his tongue made contact—a broad, flat lap along her slit, gathering her slickness. She tasted like honeyed salt—bright and addictive, her arousal coating his tongue in a glossy sheen. Mandy's head fell back, a soft whimper escaping as he delved deeper, tongue parting her delicate lips to explore the warm folds within. The heat radiated from her, enveloping his senses; he sucked gently on her clit, feeling it swell against his lips like a pulsing pearl. Wet sounds filled the kitchen—his laps, her gasps, the faint drip of her wetness as he worked her higher. "Oh, God… David," Mandy breathed, her small hands threading through his hair, tugging lightly. The pull sent jolts straight to his groin, his cock now straining painfully against the fabric. He added fingers— one at first, sliding into her extreme tightness with ease from her slickness, but the grip was intense, like a heated clamp that made him imagine how she'd feel around him fully. He curled it, stroking that inner ridge that made her hips buck, a fresh gush of arousal coating his hand.
Kelly and Liam entered then, drawn by the sounds. Kelly, still in her robe, her athletic build toned and glowing from last night's exertions, smiled wickedly. Liam, at twenty-eight, mirrored his father's build—tall, muscular, dark hair cropped short— but his eyes held a mix of lingering anger and fresh hunger after yesterday's forest encounter with Kelly. He'd fucked her roughly against the tree, years of frustration exploding in slams of skin and grunts, ending on the moss with her on all fours, leaves sticking to their sweat-slick bodies as he claimed her from behind. Now, seeing Mandy splayed on the table, his ex, with his father between her legs… the jealousy twisted into dark arousal.
"Starting without us?" Kelly teased, stepping closer to kiss Mandy deeply, their tongues mingling while David's continued his feast below.
Liam approached, shedding his shirt to reveal his chiseled torso. He cupped one of Mandy's breasts, rolling the nipple between fingers rough from construction work. "You always were a tease," he murmured, voice low.
David rose finally, lips glistening, and shed his boxers. His cock sprang free—thick, veined, the head flushed and weeping. He positioned himself at Mandy's entrance, rubbing the tip along her slit—coating himself in her slick, the friction sending sparks through them both. "Ready for me?" he asked, eyes locked on hers.
Mandy nodded, breath hitching. "Yes… please."
He pressed forward— the head breaching her with a soft yield, her tightness enveloping him in a scorching hold that made him grit his teeth. He moved with measured drives, each one sinking deeper, her walls parting like molten silk around his girth. The stretch was profound for her— a burning fullness that bordered on overwhelm, but bloomed into deep, throbbing pleasure as he bottomed out, hips flush against hers.
Mandy's back arched off the table, a cry escaping as he began to thrust—steady, powerful rolls that dragged every ridge along her sensitive inner surfaces. The table creaked under the force; her breasts bounced with each impact, nipples brushing the air in electric arcs. Sensations layered: the cool wood against her ass, the heat of his body covering hers, the wet slap of their joining echoing in the kitchen.
Kelly and Liam watched, aroused—Kelly's hand slipping between her legs, Liam's cock straining his pants. "Sit up," David commanded suddenly, slowing his thrusts.
Mandy obeyed, leveraging her core to rise—his cock still buried deep inside her. The shift drove him even further, her weight pressing down, impaling her completely. She gasped at the new depth, walls fluttering around him like a living pulse. David wrapped his arms around her waist, lifting her off the table effortlessly— her small size making it easy, her legs wrapping instinctively around his hips, arms looping around his shoulders for support.
The motion sank him impossibly deeper—gravity aiding the penetration, her tightness clamping down in response. Mandy's head fell back, a long moan tearing from her throat as he held her there, suspended, beginning to thrust upward. Each lift and drop created a rhythmic bounce—her breasts pressing against his chest, nipples scraping his skin, the friction building heat between them. The feeling was intense for her: full to bursting, every nerve alight, the angle hitting spots that made stars explode behind her eyes. Liam stepped up behind her then, his presence a warm shadow. His hands roamed her back, cupping her bubble butt, spreading the cheeks gently. "Room for one more?" he asked, voice rough with desire.
Mandy nodded frantically. "Yes… please."
He lubed himself generously—his cock thick like his father's, veined and ready—then worked her ass with fingers first. One digit circled the tight ring, pressing in slowly, the intrusion foreign but welcome amid the pleasure from David. Mandy relaxed into it, her body adapting, the dual sensation making her tremble. Liam added a second finger, scissoring gently, stretching her with care until she was rocking back onto them, moans turning desperate.
Finally, he positioned himself—head nudging her rear entrance. "Breathe, Mand," he whispered.
She did, exhaling as he pushed forward— the breach slow, a burning ring that yielded to pressure. Inch by careful inch, he filled her ass, the fullness overwhelming: David's cock in her pussy, Liam's in her ass, separated by thin walls that transmitted every throb and twitch. Mandy cried out—pain-pleasure mingling, her body stretched to limits, every nerve screaming with intensity.
They held still at first— a hug sandwich, Mandy crushed deliciously between father and son, her legs wrapped tight around David's waist, arms clinging to his shoulders. The men began to move—alternating thrusts at first, one in as the other withdrew, creating a seesaw of sensation that made her head spin. Fullness ebbed and flowed, building to a crescendo as they synced—both driving deep together, then pulling back.
The feelings were profound: for Mandy, an all-consuming pressure, her pussy and ass clenching in tandem, orgasms building like tidal waves. David's thrusts rubbed her front wall, sparking electric jolts; Liam's angled to hit new depths, the taboo of it all amplifying every slide. Sweat slicked their bodies—salty scents mingling, breaths grunting in unison, the kitchen filled with wet slaps and cries.
Kelly watched, aroused beyond measure, fingers plunging into herself as she cheered them on. "Fuck her harder… make her come."
They did—pace quickening, thrusts turning forceful. Mandy shattered first— a keening wail as dual climaxes ripped through her, walls convulsing in powerful spasms that milked both cocks. The grip pushed David over—surging deep into her pussy with hot floods. Liam followed, burying in her ass with a roar, release pulsing in thick ropes.
They lowered her gently to the table, still connected, aftershocks rippling. Mandy trembled, overwhelmed—feelings of fullness, love, taboo bliss washing over her.
The day continued in waves: garden under the oak—Mandy bent over the bench, David in her pussy, Liam in her ass again, Kelly licking where they joined. Kitchen counter: Mandy perched, legs wide, double-teamed standing as before. Afternoon streamside: on the blanket, variations with Kelly joining for triple play.
Night brought the bedroom climax: Kelly double-penetrated now—David in her pussy, Liam in her ass, Mandy fingering Liam's ass, curling to his prostate. The sandwich intensified—Kelly's cries echoing, bodies slamming in rhythm until releases crashed like thunder.
Exhausted, they slept—family forever changed, desires entwined.
