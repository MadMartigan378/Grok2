Sisterly Secrets
The fire had dimmed to a bed of glowing embers in the hearth, casting a muted crimson haze over the living room of the Welsh cottage. The air still carried the lingering traces of their earlier indulgences— the sharp tang of Rioja mixed with the earthy musk of sweat-slicked skin, the faint, sweet residue of feminine excitement hanging like a veil. Kelly, David, and Mandy lay in a loose tangle on the thick rug, bodies relaxed in the afterglow, limbs intertwined with casual intimacy. Kelly's head rested on David's broad chest, her long dark hair splayed across his skin like spilled ink, while Mandy's petite form curled against his side, her auburn waves tickling his arm, her medium breasts pressed softly against his ribs, nipples still faintly pebbled from the chill creeping in as the flames waned.
Mandy's story about her almost-first time with Liam had faded into a comfortable silence, broken only by the occasional pop of a dying log and their synchronized breaths. David stroked Mandy's back idly, his calloused fingers tracing the smooth dip of her spine, feeling the subtle rise and fall of her breathing. The confession had stirred something in him—not jealousy, but a deeper curiosity about the women beside him, how their pasts had shaped the ease with which they'd shared him, shared each other.
He turned his head slightly, pressing a kiss to Kelly's temple, tasting the faint salt of cooled perspiration on her skin. "Baby girl," he murmured, voice low and gravelly, rumbling through his chest into her ear. "You seemed so... natural with Mandy last night. Like you'd done this before. Have you? Been with another woman, I mean?"
Kelly lifted her head, hazel eyes meeting his in the ember light, a playful spark igniting amid the warmth. She glanced at Mandy, who propped herself up on an elbow, green eyes curious, a small smile tugging at her lips. The question hung between them, heavy with implication, the room's warmth amplifying the intimacy. Kelly bit her lower lip, feeling a flush creep up her neck—not from shame, but from the thrill of unveiling another layer of herself to him. "Yeah, Daddy. I have. It started with Holly, actually. My older sister."
David's hand paused on Mandy's back, his eyebrows lifting in surprise. Holly—two years older than Kelly at twenty-six, with the same fair skin but long blonde hair that fell in soft waves, a curvier build from her days as a swimmer rather than a runner. She'd moved to London for work years ago, but visited sporadically, her presence always a reminder of the family's fractured past after the divorce. He remembered her as protective, bold, with a laugh that filled rooms. The idea of her and Kelly... it sent an unexpected jolt through him, his cock twitching faintly against Kelly's thigh. "Holly? When?"
Kelly shifted, sitting up fully now, her breasts swaying gently with the motion, the candlelight from the mantel catching the subtle sheen of lingering moisture on her skin. She pulled the blanket around her waist, the soft wool brushing her hips like a whisper. Mandy leaned in closer, her small hand resting on Kelly's knee, thumb circling soothingly, the touch warm and encouraging. The scent of their combined arousal lingered, tangy and inviting, as Kelly gathered her thoughts.
"It was back when we were living in the old house in Sheffield, before Mom left," Kelly began, voice soft but steady, carrying over the faint crackle of the fire. "Holly was twenty, I was eighteen—just starting uni, still living at home. One night, after everyone was supposed to be asleep, we heard noises from your room. You and Mom... you know." She smiled faintly, a mix of nostalgia and mischief in her eyes. The memory flooded back: the creak of the bedframe, low moans filtering through the walls, the rhythmic thump that had drawn them from their rooms like a siren's call.
David nodded slowly, his hand sliding to Kelly's thigh, squeezing gently, the rough texture of his palm grounding against her smooth skin. He could picture it—the passion he his wife had shared before things soured, raw and uninhibited. "Go on," he encouraged, breath warm against her shoulder, carrying the faint, woody aftertaste of wine.
"We snuck down the hall," Kelly continued, her fingers intertwining with Mandy's, the small gesture sending a tingle up her arm. "The door was cracked open—just a sliver, but enough to see. You were on top, moving with her, so intense. The way Mom arched under you, gasping... it was hypnotic. We stood there, frozen, hearts pounding. I felt this heat building between my legs, slick and insistent. Holly too—she reached down, started touching herself right there in the hallway, her breaths coming short and shaky. I followed, my fingers slipping under my nightshirt, circling that sensitive spot until my knees nearly buckled."
Mandy's eyes widened slightly, her hand tightening on Kelly's knee, the pressure firm and arousing. The room felt smaller, the air thicker, as if the confession was weaving a new layer of heat around them. David felt his pulse quicken, the image vivid: his daughters, young adults discovering their desires through a stolen glimpse. No violation, just the spark of curiosity igniting something consensual between them.
"We couldn't stay there," Kelly said, voice dropping lower, husky now. "Holly grabbed my hand, pulled me to her room. The door clicked shut behind us, and we tumbled onto her bed, giggling at first to cover the nervousness. But then... it turned serious. She kissed me—soft, exploratory, tasting like the mint toothpaste we'd both used. Her lips were fuller than mine, warm and yielding. We peeled off our nightshirts, exploring with hands first: tracing each other's breasts, feeling the weight and give, nipples hardening under palms like ripening fruit. The air in her room smelled of lavender from her sheets, mixed with our growing excitement—sweet and sharp."
David groaned softly, his free hand moving to adjust himself, the fabric of the blanket tenting as his arousal grew. Mandy leaned in, pressing a kiss to Kelly's shoulder, tasting the faint salt there, her breath hot and encouraging. "Sounds beautiful," Mandy whispered, voice laced with want. "What happened next?"
Kelly's cheeks flushed deeper, but she pressed on, the words flowing like a release. "We mirrored what we'd seen. Holly went down first—her tongue tentative at my core, lapping at the gathered moisture, the flavor tangy on her lips when she came up to kiss me. I returned it, burying my face between her thighs, inhaling her musky scent, feeling her thighs quiver around my ears. The sounds—wet slides, muffled sighs—echoed in the quiet house. We came like that, bodies shuddering in waves, fingers tangled in hair."
The embers popped loudly, as if punctuating her words. David's hand slid higher on Kelly's thigh, fingers brushing the edge of her mound, feeling the renewed slickness there. The touch was electric, her skin prickling under his rough pads. "And it didn't stop there?" he asked, voice thick, the question stirring his own heat.
"No," Kelly admitted, leaning into his touch, a soft moan escaping as his finger dipped lower, parting her folds to trace the warm seam. "We kept it up for years—sneaking into each other's rooms after lights out, whenever we were both home. It was our secret ritual. We'd experiment more: using a hairbrush handle one time, the smooth wood sliding in slow, filling that ache with a firm pressure that made us gasp. And once... we stole your electric toothbrush from the bathroom. The vibrations—buzzing against our most sensitive spots—sent us over the edge so fast, bodies arching off the bed, the hum muffled under pillows to keep quiet."
Mandy's breath hitched, her hand joining David's between Kelly's legs, fingers intertwining in the slick warmth, the dual touch drawing a whimper from Kelly. The scents intensified—salty skin, sweet arousal blending with the fading smoke from the fire. David pulled Kelly closer, his lips capturing hers in a deep kiss, tongue delving to taste the wine and want on her.  "That's so fucking hot," he growled against her mouth, his hardness pressing insistently against her hip, the head leaking a warm trail of pre-cum onto her skin.
The confession ignited them anew. Mandy straddled David's thigh, grinding slowly, her small channel leaving a glossy streak on his muscle, the friction eliciting shared groans. Kelly turned fully, positioning herself over him, guiding his length to her entrance. The breach was deliberate—a slow descent where her walls parted in yielding layers, enveloping him in a pulsing embrace that felt like liquid fire coiling around his shaft. No familiar phrases; tonight, it was a searing clasp, drawing him deeper with rhythmic contractions that echoed her heartbeat.
They moved together, bodies syncing in a sensual rhythm: Kelly rising and falling, breasts shifting with each motion, nipples grazing his chest in teasing sweeps. Mandy watched, then joined—her tongue tracing where they connected, lapping at the joined slickness, the taste a blend of salty essence and tangy nectar. Sounds filled the room: skin meeting in muted impacts, wet glides, breathy pleas of "Daddy" and "More." David's hands gripped Kelly's hips, thumbs pressing into the soft give, guiding her pace as pleasure built.
When release came, it crashed through Kelly first—her body tensing, inner muscles fluttering in fervent spasms, a rush of warmth bathing him. The sensation pulled him under, his hips bucking as he spilled deep, pulses thick and hot, filling her until it seeped back along their join. Mandy followed, her fingers circling her own peak, cries blending with theirs in a harmonious crescendo.
They collapsed in a heap, breaths ragged, the fire's last glow illuminating their satisfied forms. David kissed Kelly's forehead, tasting the sheen of effort there. "Thank you for sharing that, love. Makes me love you more." Mandy nodded, cuddling closer, the trio drifting into sleep with whispers of future confessions, the night wrapping them in its warm embrace.
