Forest Reckonings and Shared Flames
The afternoon sun dipped low over the Welsh hills, casting long shadows through the cottage windows as Liam packed his bag in the guest room. He'd stayed an extra night after his surprise visit, the air thick with unspoken tension. Beers and football had kept things surface-level, but Liam wasn't blind. The glances between Kelly and David—too lingering, too intimate. Mandy's presence, her easy laughter with them both, felt off. His ex, here? And the way she'd flushed when he'd hugged her goodbye earlier… something simmered beneath the family facade.
He slung his bag over his shoulder, heading downstairs. Voices drifted from the living room—low murmurs, a soft giggle. Liam paused at the doorframe, heart thudding. Through the crack, he saw it: Kelly on the sofa, legs spread, David's head between her thighs. Mandy knelt beside, kissing Kelly deeply, one hand cupping her breast. The fire crackled softly, but the sounds were unmistakable—wet laps, breathy moans, Kelly's whispered "Daddy…"
Liam's world tilted. Rage boiled up—betrayal, confusion, a dark twist of something else he couldn't name. His sister… with their father? And Mandy? He backed away silently, storming out the front door, slamming it hard enough to rattle the windows. He didn't stop—stalked down the garden path, through the gate, into the nearby forest where trails wound through ancient oaks and ferns.
Kelly heard the slam, lifting her head mid-moan. "Was that… Liam?"
David paused, face glistening. "Shit. He must've seen."
Kelly scrambled up, pulling on clothes. "I'll go after him. Talk him down."
Mandy touched her arm. "Be careful. He's… complicated."
Kelly nodded, dashing out. The forest air was cool, scented with pine and damp earth. She followed the trail she knew Liam favored—uphill, toward the old clearing. Her heart raced—not just from the run, but the fear of exposure, the thrill of the secret shattering.
She found him leaning against a massive oak, fists clenched, staring at the ground. Dry leaves crunched under her feet as she approached. "Liam… wait."
He spun, eyes blazing. "What the fuck, Kel? Dad? And Mandy? My ex? How long has this been going on?"
Kelly stopped a few feet away, hands raised. "It's… complicated. Started recently. But it's real. We love each other."
Liam laughed bitterly. "Love? That's sick. And Mandy—did you drag her into your twisted little family game?"
"No," Kelly said firmly. "She wanted it. We all do. It's consensual, Liam. No one's getting hurt."
He paced, raking hands through his dark hair. "I saw you. Heard you call him 'Daddy.' Jesus, Kel. We're family."
"We are," she stepped closer. "But that doesn't mean we can't feel more. You've always been protective of me. Jealous, even."
Liam stopped, facing her. "Jealous? Of Dad? That's…"
Kelly reached out, intending a comforting kiss on his cheek. But he turned at the same moment to say something—their lips met instead. Soft, accidental. Time froze.
Then years of buried frustration erupted. Liam's hands cupped her face, deepening the kiss—fierce, demanding. Tongues clashed; breaths mingled hot and urgent. Kelly pressed against him, feeling his hardness through jeans, her own arousal flaring like wildfire.
"Liam…" she gasped, but he spun her against the tree, bark rough against her back through her shirt. "Shut up," he growled, voice rough with need. His hands yanked her top up, exposing her breasts to the cool air. Nipples peaked instantly; he pinched one hard, drawing a yelp that turned moan. His mouth claimed hers again, biting her lower lip as his other hand fumbled her jeans open, shoving them down with her panties.
Kelly kicked them off one leg, wrapping it around his waist. "Fuck me," she demanded, nails raking his back under his shirt.
Liam freed himself—cock thick like his father's, veined and throbbing. He lifted her other leg, pinning her against the tree, and thrust in hard— no gentle entry, just raw possession. Kelly cried out at the sudden fullness, the stretch bordering on pain but flooding with pleasure. The bark scraped her back with each powerful drive; leaves rustled under their feet.
He fucked her roughly—hips slamming, breaths grunting. "This what you want?" he snarled. "From your brother?"
"Yes," she hissed, claws digging into his shoulders. "Harder."
They moved like animals—years of sibling tension exploding. Liam's hand wrapped her throat lightly, possessive; hers pulled his hair, urging him deeper. The forest echoed with slaps of skin, her moans, his growls.
When she came—body seizing, walls spasming like a vise—he didn't stop, pounding through it until his own release hit, flooding her with hot jets.
They slid down the tree, still joined, onto the moss and dry leaves. Liam flipped her onto hands and knees, entering from behind—deeper now, hands gripping her hips hard enough to bruise. Leaves stuck to their sweat-slick skin; the earthy scent mixed with sex.
Kelly pushed back, meeting each thrust. "Don't stop… fuck, Liam…"
He did—relentless, almost punishing, until another orgasm ripped through her, soaking them both. He followed, pulling out to spill across her ass, marking her.
They collapsed, panting, leaves in hair, bodies trembling. Liam pulled her close, anger spent. "What now?"
Kelly kissed him softly. "Come back. Join us."
He hesitated, then nodded.
Back at the house, tension hung thick. Liam entered silently; David and Mandy looked up from the sofa, eyes questioning.
Kelly took Liam's hand. "We talked. He's… in."
David stood, clapping his son on the shoulder. "Welcome, son."
That night, after dinner and more wine, they retreated to the bedroom. The girls were giggly-drunk; the men buzzed with anticipation.
Kelly and Mandy stripped first, kneeling on the bed. David and Liam undressed, cocks hard—father and son mirroring each other in build and desire.
Kelly took David from behind—his thick length sliding into her with a deep, fulfilling push. She leaned forward, sucking Liam's cock—tongue swirling the head, taking him deep as David thrust steadily.
Mandy mirrored with Liam—bent over, his hips driving into her tight heat while she sucked David, small mouth stretching around his girth.
They swapped: David behind Mandy now, savoring her extreme snugness—each stroke a delicious friction, her bubble butt jiggling with impacts. Kelly sucked David while Mandy took Liam's length in her mouth, throat working him eagerly.
The air filled with wet sounds, moans, the bed creaking. Wine loosened inhibitions; positions flowed.
Finally, the peak: David on his back, Kelly straddling him reverse—sinking down onto his cock. Liam knelt behind, lubing himself, then pressing into her ass—gentle at first, then deeper. Kelly gasped at the double fullness—stretched beyond belief, pleasure bordering overload.
Mandy knelt beside, fingers sliding into Liam's ass—probing, curling to hit his prostate. He groaned, thrusting harder.
Kelly came explosively—body convulsing, drawing releases from both men. Hot pulses filled her; Mandy's touch pushed Liam over with a roar.
They collapsed, spent, in a heap of limbs and whispers—family redefined, secrets shared.
