Kitchen Surrender
The late afternoon sun slanted through the kitchen windows of the Welsh cottage, turning the tiled floor golden and warming the air with the scent of fresh-cut herbs from the windowsill pots. Kelly had just returned from her run—cheeks flushed, skin glistening with a light sheen of sweat, long dark hair pulled into a high ponytail that swung like a pendulum. She wore her favorite black running leggings, the tight, high-waisted fabric clinging to every curve of her athletic runner's legs and ass like a second skin. The top was cropped, exposing a strip of toned midriff still heaving with each breath.
She leaned forward over the kitchen counter, elbows braced, palms flat against the cool granite, stretching out the tightness in her lower back and hamstrings. The position arched her spine, pushing her ass out invitingly—round, firm, perfectly outlined by the stretched material. A soft sigh escaped her as she rolled her hips slightly, working out a knot.
David walked in from the hallway, stopping dead in the doorway. The sight hit him like a physical force: his daughter bent over the counter, leggings molded to her body, the faint outline of no panties visible beneath the thin fabric, sweat-dampened skin glowing in the light. His cock twitched instantly, thickening against his jeans. He crossed the room silently, drawn like gravity.
Kelly felt him before she heard him—the shift in the air, the warmth of his presence behind her. She didn't straighten; instead she stayed bent, glancing over her shoulder with a playful, knowing smile. "Hey, Daddy. Good run. I'm all sweaty and sore again."
David stepped right up to her, hips brushing hers. His large hands settled on her lower back, thumbs pressing gently into the dimples above her ass. "I can see that," he murmured, voice low and rough. He began stroking—slow, firm glides up her spine, feeling the heat of her skin through the thin top, the subtle tremble of overworked muscles.
Kelly arched into his touch, a soft moan slipping out. "Mmm… that feels good."
His hands roamed higher, then one slid up to gather her ponytail in a gentle fist. He tugged lightly—not hard, just enough to tilt her head back so he could see her face, her parted lips, the flush on her cheeks. "You've been teasing me all week with these runs," he said, breath hot against her ear. "Coming home like this… bent over… ass right there for me."
She bit her lip, eyes darkening. "Maybe I like knowing you're watching."
David pressed closer, letting her feel his hardness against her ass. His free hand slid down, cupping one cheek through the leggings, squeezing the firm flesh. "I want more today, baby girl. All of you."
Kelly's breath hitched. They'd teased anal play before—gentle fingers, rimming—but never full penetration. The idea sent a thrill through her core, heat pooling between her legs. "Yes," she whispered. "I want it. With you. Gentle… please."
He released her hair only to slide both hands to her waistband. Slowly, reverently, he peeled the leggings down over her hips, exposing the smooth, pale skin of her ass, the cleft parting slightly as she stayed bent. No panties—just bare, waxed perfection, her pussy already glistening, small delicate lips flushed and swollen from the run and anticipation.
David groaned at the sight. He dropped to his knees behind her, hands spreading her cheeks gently. His tongue traced the cleft first—warm, wet laps from her dripping pussy up to her tight rear entrance. Kelly whimpered, pushing back. He circled the puckered ring slowly, tasting her—clean, musky, faintly salty from sweat. His tongue pressed flatter, then pointed, teasing the sensitive skin until she was trembling.
"Relax for me," he murmured against her, voice vibrating through her. One hand reached around to circle her clit softly, keeping her aroused while he worked. When she softened, he pressed the tip of his tongue inside—just shallow, gentle—then withdrew, repeating until she moaned louder, hips rocking.
Rising, he shed his jeans and boxers, cock springing free—thick, veined, already leaking. He coated himself generously with the lube he'd grabbed from the drawer (they kept it everywhere now), then slicked her entrance too, fingers circling, pressing one knuckle in slowly.
Kelly gasped at the stretch—foreign, intense, but good. "More," she breathed.
He added a second finger, scissoring gently, letting her adjust. The tightness was exquisite—hot, gripping, velvet. When she was rocking back onto his hand, moaning softly, he withdrew and positioned himself.
"Deep breaths, baby," he said, voice tender. The head pressed against her—slow, insistent pressure. Kelly exhaled, pushing out as he'd taught her. The crown popped past the ring with a soft, wet sound. She cried out—sharp pleasure-pain—then relaxed as he held still, letting her adjust.
"Good girl," he praised, stroking her back soothingly. "So fucking tight… so perfect."
Inch by inch he sank deeper, pausing every few seconds, whispering encouragement. The fullness was overwhelming for her—stretching, claiming, intimate in a way nothing else had been. When he bottomed out, hips flush against her ass, they both shuddered.
He stayed motionless for long moments, letting her feel him, letting the burn ease into deep, throbbing pleasure. Then he began to move—tiny, shallow thrusts at first, barely withdrawing. Kelly moaned, fingers gripping the counter edge.
"More," she begged.
He built slowly—longer strokes, deeper, finding a rhythm. The sensation was incredible for both: the tight grip, the heat, the taboo intimacy. His hand returned to her clit, rubbing in time with his thrusts. The kitchen filled with wet sounds, her moans, his low groans.
When she came—walls clenching hard around him in powerful pulses—he nearly lost control. He thrust through her orgasm, then pulled out gently, turning her to face him.
Kelly dropped to her knees without a word, mouth open. She took him deep—tongue swirling, throat relaxing as she swallowed around his length. The taste of lube, her own body, his pre-cum—salty, musky—filled her mouth. David fisted her ponytail gently, guiding but not forcing.
When he warned her, she only hummed, taking him to the root. He came with a guttural groan—hot spurts straight down her throat. Kelly swallowed every drop, milking him until he was spent, then licked him clean with soft, loving strokes.
They stayed like that for a minute—her cheek against his thigh, his hand stroking her hair—before he helped her up, pulling her into a deep kiss.
"Shower?" she asked, voice hoarse.
He smiled. "Shower."
Under the hot spray, they washed each other slowly—hands soaping skin, lingering on breasts, ass, between legs. When he was hard again, he lifted her against the tiles, legs wrapped around him, entering her pussy this time—deep, steady thrusts under the cascading water.
They came together—her nails digging into his shoulders, his mouth on her neck—then stood under the water, holding each other as steam filled the room.
Wrapped in towels later, curled on the couch, Kelly nestled into his side. "I love how you take care of me," she whispered. "Every part."
David kissed her forehead. "Every part of you is mine, baby girl. Always."
