Tangled Returns
The morning after their firelit revelations dawned crisp and bright over the Welsh countryside, sunlight filtering through the bedroom curtains in golden slants that danced across the rumpled sheets. David stirred first, his muscular frame stretching lazily, salt-and-pepper hair tousled from the night's indulgences. At forty-eight, he felt more alive than he had in years—flanked by two beautiful women, their bodies warm and soft against his. Kelly lay on his left, her long dark hair fanned across the pillow, fair skin still marked with faint love bites from Mandy's eager mouth. On his right, Mandy curled like a contented cat—petite at five feet, her auburn waves spilling over her medium breasts, which rose and fell with each breath, her cute bubble butt nestled against his thigh.
Memories of the previous evening flooded back: Mandy's confession about her almost-first time with Liam, the way it had ignited them all, leading to hours of tangled exploration. David had taken Mandy gently but thoroughly, marveling at her extreme tightness—how her small channel had hugged him like a custom glove, hot and unyielding yet yielding just enough under his careful thrusts. Kelly had watched with heated eyes, joining in with kisses and touches that amplified every sensation.
But now, as the women slumbered, David's phone buzzed on the nightstand. He glanced at the screen—Liam. His son, calling from Sheffield.
"Dad," Liam's voice came through, a bit hesitant. "Hey, uh… mind if I swing by today? Got some time off work, thought I'd visit. Been too long."
David's pulse quickened. Liam—Kelly's brother, Mandy's ex. The timing was uncanny, after Mandy's story. "Of course, son. Door's always open. When you thinking?"
"Around lunchtime? I'll bring some beers."
"See you then."
He hung up, mind racing. Reintroducing Liam now felt loaded—especially with Mandy here, naked in his bed. But the thrill of the secret, the risk, only added to the fire that had been kindling since that stormy night with Kelly.
Kelly stirred, hazel eyes opening sleepily. "Who was that?"
"Your brother. Coming for a visit today."
Mandy murmured from his other side, stretching like a kitten. "Liam? Here?"
David nodded, hand sliding down to cup her breast, thumb brushing the dusky peak until it stiffened like a pebble. "Yeah. But we've got the morning first."
The women exchanged glances—playful, heated. Kelly leaned over David to kiss Mandy softly, lips parting in a slow exploration that tasted of sleep and lingering wine. "Then let's wake him properly."
They slid down his body in unison, breaths hot against his skin. Kelly started at the base, her tongue tracing the thick vein along his shaft with firm, deliberate laps, savoring the musky morning flavor of him. Mandy focused on the head, her small mouth enveloping it with gentle suction, lips stretching around the girth as her tongue flicked the sensitive underside in teasing circles.
David groaned, hands fisting in the sheets. The contrast was exquisite—Kelly's confident, deeper strokes versus Mandy's delicate, swirling attention. They traded places seamlessly: Kelly deep-throating him now, throat relaxing to take him fully, the wet constriction drawing a low rumble from his chest; Mandy licking his balls, small hands cupping and massaging with surprising firmness.
When he was throbbing, slick with their combined saliva, Kelly climbed astride him. She positioned herself, rubbing her flushed entrance along his length first—coating him in her gathering moisture, the slick friction eliciting shared sighs. Then she lowered, enveloping him in a warm, snug embrace that drew out slowly, her inner muscles rippling like a living current around him.
Mandy watched, fingers circling her own clit, then straddled David's thigh—grinding her heat against the hard muscle, leaving a trail of wetness. Kelly rode him with building intensity—hips undulating in fluid waves, breasts swaying with each rise and fall. David thrust up to meet her, hands on her waist guiding the pace.
Mandy leaned in, kissing Kelly deeply—tongues tangling, sharing the taste of him still on their lips. Her small breasts pressed against Kelly's, nipples brushing in electric friction. David reached between Mandy's legs, fingers delving into her tight folds—probing the extreme constriction that had captivated him last night, curling to hit that sensitive ridge inside.
Kelly peaked first—body tensing, a cascade of contractions surging through her like a tidal pull, drawing him deeper. The sight and feel pushed Mandy over—her petite frame shuddering against his thigh, release flooding his fingers in warm pulses.
David held back just long enough to flip them. He took Mandy now—entering her missionary-style, the position allowing him to savor her smallness. She was incredibly compact, her channel clenching around him like a heated vice, every inch a delicious struggle. He moved with restraint at first—shallow glides that built to fuller, deeper drives, her bubble butt lifting to meet him.
Kelly knelt beside, fingers teasing Mandy's clit in rapid circles, then leaning down to suck one nipple—drawing it into her mouth with firm pulls that made Mandy arch and whimper.
David's release built like a storm—cresting in powerful surges that filled Mandy completely, her tightness coaxing every drop. They collapsed, breaths ragged, bodies slick with effort.
After a quick shower—three under the spray, hands soaping curves and planes, light touches reigniting sparks—they dressed casually for breakfast. In the kitchen, over coffee and toast slathered with jam, the conversation turned light, but the undercurrent hummed.
Liam arrived just past noon, pulling up in his battered Ford with a six-pack under one arm. At twenty-eight, he looked much like a younger David—tall, muscular from his construction job, dark hair cropped short, a easy grin that hid the restlessness from his breakup with Mandy. He hugged Kelly warmly, clapped David on the back.
"Smells good in here," Liam said, sniffing the air. "You cooking already?"
"Just breakfast leftovers," Kelly replied, glancing at Mandy—who had stayed, ostensibly for "girl time" with Kelly. Mandy stood in the doorway, auburn hair loose, her petite frame in jeans and a fitted top that accentuated her curves. Liam froze for a beat, eyes widening.
"Mandy? What… hey."
Mandy smiled awkwardly, but her green eyes sparkled. "Hey, Liam. Kelly invited me over. Been catching up."
The tension was palpable—old flames, unfinished business. David watched, a possessive twinge in his chest, but also curiosity. Lunch was awkward at first—sandwiches around the table, small talk about jobs and weather. But beers loosened tongues. Liam asked about Mandy's life in Bristol; she teased him about his single status.
As the afternoon wore on, the group moved to the living room. Football on TV, more beers. Liam and David discussed the match; Kelly and Mandy whispered on the sofa, giggling. The story Mandy had told last night hung unspoken, charging the air.
When Liam stepped out for a smoke, Mandy leaned into Kelly. "Seeing him… brings it all back. But you two… God, it's better."
David overheard, pulling her onto his lap discreetly while Liam was gone. "Jealous?" he murmured. Mandy ground subtly against him. "No. Turned on."
Liam returned, none the wiser. The day passed in easy companionship—board games, more laughs. But under it, the secret pulsed.
Evening brought dinner—David grilling steaks in the garden while the others prepped salads. As night fell, Liam crashed on the guest room couch, a bit drunk from the beers. "Thanks for having me, Dad. Kel. Mandy… good seeing you."
Once his snores echoed down the hall, the three retreated to the master bedroom. Wine flowed again—the girls tipsy, cheeks rosy; David buzzed from the day's tension and the women's teasing touches under the table.
Mandy stripped first, her small body revealed in the lamplight—breasts pert, nipples like dark wine stains, bubble butt begging attention. She pushed David onto the bed, climbing astride his face—lowering her heat onto his mouth. He licked her with hunger—tongue parting her tight folds, savoring the fresh, tangy essence, delving deep as her thighs quivered around his ears.
Kelly knelt behind Mandy, hands spreading her cheeks, tongue teasing her rear entrance in light, circling laps that made Mandy buck. David felt the vibrations of her moans against his lips.
They switched: Kelly riding David's cock—sinking down in a smooth descent, her warmth sheathing him in rippling waves. Mandy straddled his chest, grinding against his abs while kissing Kelly.
David took Mandy anally next—gentle, as always. On her hands and knees, he prepared her with lubed fingers—stretching the tight ring until she relaxed, pushing back. Entry was slow—head breaching with a soft yield, then deeper glides that filled her completely, the constriction like a fiery ring around him. Mandy's cries were muffled into the pillow; Kelly's fingers on her clit brought her to a shaking crest.
The night blurred: David on his back, girls in 69 above him—he thrusting into Kelly from below while licking Mandy. Then Mandy riding reverse, her bubble butt bouncing as David teased her pussy with fingers. Orgasms rolled like waves—each unique, building on the last.
Morning repeated the ritual: girls waking him with mouths—alternating sucks, shared licks until he arched and released down Kelly's throat. Breakfast turned playful—Kelly bent over the counter, David taking her from behind while Mandy watched, then joined by licking Kelly's breasts.
Garden interlude: under the oak, Mandy on the bench, legs over David's shoulders as he entered her—deep, angled thrusts that hit new depths in her small frame. Kelly kept lookout, fingers busy between her own legs.
Lunch in the kitchen: Mandy on the counter, David feasting on her while Kelly fed him bites, then switched—Kelly riding him on a chair, Mandy's mouth on her clit.
Afternoon hike: by the stream, blanket spread. Girls in 69, David alternating between them—thrusting into one while fingering the other.
Evening by the fire: slow, circular lovemaking—David seated, girls taking turns on his lap, kissing each other above.
Liam left the next day, oblivious. But the secret had grown—now including him in memory, if not in body. The three promised more weekends, more tangles, the forbidden web tightening deliciously.
