Stormy Confessions – Extended Director’s Cut (Doubled Length)
The summer storm had arrived with theatrical fury over the Welsh countryside, the sky turning an inky violet before splitting open with rain that drummed relentlessly against the slate roof and leaded windows of their old stone cottage. Inside, the living room was a warm cocoon: the hearth fire crackling steadily, casting dancing amber light across the worn Persian rug, while a half-dozen pillar candles on the mantel and side tables flickered in time with each gust that rattled the panes. The air was thick with layered scents—wet earth and pine carried on the cool draft from the slightly open window, the smoky sweetness of burning oak logs, the faint herbal trace of chamomile tea cooling in David’s forgotten mug, and now, something far more intimate: the rising perfume of aroused skin.
David reclined in the deep leather armchair, legs stretched toward the fire, a paperback thriller abandoned open on his thigh. At forty-eight he remained imposing—six-foot-two, shoulders broad from decades of manual labor, forearms thick and corded, hands large and roughened by calluses yet surprisingly precise. His short salt-and-pepper hair gleamed in the firelight; faint lines at the corners of his eyes spoke of years of quiet laughter and private worry. The divorce five years earlier had left the house too silent, but Kelly had filled the emptiness. Lately, though, that comfort had twisted into something dangerous—something he fought every night as forbidden images of her invaded his dreams.
The front door flew open on a blast of wet wind. Kelly stepped inside, breathless and laughing, rain sluicing off her in silver sheets. Twenty-four years old and radiant with life, she was all lean muscle and graceful curves from years of trail running: long, powerful legs glistening, fair skin flushed with exertion and lightly tanned from summer miles, long dark hair plastered in wet ropes to her shoulders and down her back. The black sports bra and matching shorts were soaked through, clinging transparently to her body—outlining the firm, high swell of her 36B breasts, the narrow dip of her waist, the subtle flare of athletic hips. Her nipples stood erect against the chilled fabric; rivulets of water traced paths down her toned stomach and vanished beneath the low waistband.
“Jesus, Dad, it’s like the sky opened a firehose,” she said, kicking off muddy trainers and arching into a full-body stretch. Arms overhead, she tipped her head back, groaning as tight muscles protested. The motion lifted her breasts, the wet material turning nearly sheer. “My quads are screaming. And my lower back feels like it’s been tied in knots.”
David’s mouth went dry. He tried to anchor his gaze on her face—those wide hazel eyes sparkling with mischief, the playful pout of her lips—but his eyes drifted inexorably downward. The way the rain had molded every curve to her skin was hypnotic. “You should have checked the radar,” he said, voice coming out lower, rougher than usual. “Go shower. Warm up.”
Kelly padded closer instead, bare feet leaving faint wet prints on the hardwood. She stopped directly in front of him, close enough that he could smell her: fresh rain, warm exertion-sweat, vanilla-musk perfume sharpened by body heat, and the faintest, sweetest undercurrent of feminine arousal. “Remember after track meets?” she asked, voice soft, teasing. “You’d sit me on the kitchen table and work out the cramps. Your hands were magic.”
“That was different,” he said, throat tight. “You were a kid.”
“I’m not a kid anymore.” She held his gaze, unflinching. “And I’m really sore, Daddy. Please? Just my legs and back. I trust you more than anyone.”
The word Daddy hit him like a physical blow—innocent on the surface, loaded with everything they’d both been pretending didn’t exist. David exhaled hard through his nose. “Lie down on the rug. On your stomach.”
Kelly’s heart slammed against her ribs as she obeyed, lowering herself to the thick wool rug, arms folded under her cheek. The fire warmed her right side; the cool draft kissed her left. She felt the rug’s soft nap against her bare stomach, the heat of the flames licking at her skin. Above her, David’s presence loomed—big, solid, radiating warmth and tension.
He knelt, knees bracketing her hips. His first touches were careful: strong thumbs pressing into the tight muscles of her shoulders through the soaked bra straps. The fabric was practically nothing; he could feel the heat of her skin, the subtle play of muscle and bone beneath. He worked methodically, kneading deeper, letting his palms glide along her upper back.
Kelly sighed, melting. “God… yes, right there.”
The sound vibrated straight to his groin. He moved lower, thumbs tracing her spine, fingers splaying wide. When his hands brushed the outer curves of her breasts, she didn’t tense—she arched, pressing up into the contact. David’s breath hitched. He shifted attention to her lower back, circling the dimples above her ass, letting his fingertips dip just beneath the waistband of her shorts.
“Lower,” she whispered.
His hands slid to her thighs, kneading the powerful runner’s muscles. The scent of her grew stronger—sweat, rain, vanilla, and now the unmistakable musk of her arousal. His thumbs drifted higher, brushing the sensitive crease where thigh met ass. Kelly moaned—low, throaty, unashamed.
“Daddy… don’t stop.”
The plea shattered his restraint.
He leaned over her, one hand still on her thigh, the other sliding up to cradle her cheek. “Kelly,” he rasped, voice gravel, “this crossed the line five minutes ago.”
She turned her head, eyes dark and molten in the firelight. “Good. I’ve wanted to cross it for years. I want you. All of you. I love you, Daddy. Not just as my father. As the man who makes me feel safe… and so fucking turned on.”
Thunder rolled through the house like an approving growl. David groaned, low and broken, and took her mouth in a kiss that started gentle—testing—then turned ravenous. Her lips were soft, tasting of rain and faint mint. Their tongues met, slow and deep, exploring every texture, every flavor. She tasted like home and sin all at once.
Kelly rolled beneath him, pulling him down until his weight pinned her deliciously to the rug. Her hands roamed his back, tugging impatiently at his shirt. “Off. I need to feel your skin.”
He reared back, yanking the t-shirt over his head in one motion. Firelight played across his broad chest, the dusting of dark hair silvered at the edges, the hard ridges of muscle earned through years of labor. Kelly’s palms flattened against his pecs, feeling the rapid thud of his heart, the warmth radiating from him.
“You’re beautiful,” she breathed, fingers tracing the lines of his body.
David’s hands trembled only slightly as he peeled her sports bra up and off. Her breasts spilled free—firm, perfectly shaped, nipples already tight and dusky-rose from arousal and the chill. He cupped them reverently, thumbs brushing the peaks. The weight in his palms was exquisite: warm, soft yet resilient, the skin silky beneath his rough fingers. He lowered his head, taking one nipple into his mouth, sucking gently, then harder, tongue flicking the hard bud. Kelly arched, fingers knotting in his hair, a broken moan spilling from her throat.
He kissed lower, slow and deliberate, tasting the salt of her skin, the faint sweetness of rain that still clung to her. When he reached her shorts he hooked his fingers in the waistband. Kelly lifted her hips. The fabric slid down her legs, leaving her bare.
Her pussy was a revelation: a smooth, gently raised mound, pale and flawless, leading to small, delicate outer lips flushed deep pink and already glistening with arousal. The inner folds peeked out, slick and inviting, the scent rising—musky, sweet, tangy, intoxicatingly feminine.
David groaned, the sound raw. “You’re fucking perfect.” He parted her thighs wider, settling between them. His thumbs traced the outer lips, feeling their plush softness, the radiant heat. Then he leaned in, inhaling deeply, letting her aroma flood his senses before his tongue made the first slow pass along her slit.
Kelly cried out, hips jerking. His tongue was warm, broad, lapping at her with deliberate patience, gathering her wetness. She tasted like salted honey—bright, addictive, utterly her. He circled her clit with the tip of his tongue, then sucked gently, feeling it swell and pulse against his lips. Wet, obscene sounds filled the room as he devoured her, alternating long licks with gentle suction, occasionally dipping lower to press inside her entrance.
After minutes of exquisite torment, David rose, kissing his way back up her body—lingering at her navel, lavishing her breasts again, finally claiming her mouth so she could taste herself on his tongue.
Kelly reached between them, fingers wrapping around his cock—thick, veined, leaking steadily. She guided him, rubbing the swollen head along her slick folds, coating him in her arousal. The sight was filthy and beautiful: his flushed shaft sliding between her delicate pink lips, glistening with her cream.
“Inside me, Daddy,” she whispered, voice trembling with need. “I want to feel you. All of you.”
He braced on his forearms, eyes locked on hers. Slowly—agonizingly—he pressed forward. The first breach was exquisite: her entrance yielding, then gripping him with scalding, velvet tightness. Inch by inch he sank deeper, feeling every flutter, every ripple of her inner walls hugging him. When he bottomed out, pelvis flush against hers, they both shuddered.
For long moments they simply existed—foreheads touching, breaths mingling, connected in the most profound way possible.
Then he began to move—slow, deep rolls of his hips that dragged every ridge along her sensitive walls. The wet sounds of their joining mingled with the crackling fire and distant thunder. Kelly wrapped her legs around his waist, heels digging into his ass, urging him deeper, harder.
After a while she pushed at his chest. “I want to ride you.”
David rolled them so she straddled him. Kelly braced her hands on his chest and began to move—slowly at first, savoring the stretch, the fullness, then faster, wilder. Her hips circled, ground down, bounced with abandon. Her breasts swayed hypnotically; long hair whipped around her flushed face. She was pure lust—head thrown back, lips parted on continuous moans, lost in the rhythm.
David was mesmerized. He watched, transfixed, as his cock disappeared into her over and over—glistening with her cream, her delicate lips clinging to his shaft on every upstroke, stretching beautifully around his girth on the downstroke.
“God, look at you taking me,” he growled, hands gripping her hips. “So fucking beautiful. So mine.”
She leaned forward, changing the angle, grinding her clit against his pubic bone until her orgasm crashed through her—walls pulsing, milking him in rhythmic waves. The sight and sensation shoved him over the edge. With a guttural groan he thrust up hard, burying himself to the hilt and coming deep inside her, hot pulses that seemed endless, filling her completely.
Kelly collapsed onto his chest, trembling, breath ragged. David wrapped his arms around her, still buried inside, feeling the aftershocks ripple through them both. His cock softened
gradually, but he made no move to withdraw; the warmth, the intimacy, the connection was too perfect to break.
They lay tangled like that for long minutes—fire popping softly, candles guttering low, rain tapping a gentle lullaby against the windows.
Eventually their breathing slowed, bodies heavy with satisfaction and exhaustion. Kelly nuzzled into his neck, pressing soft kisses to his pulse point. “Don’t move,” she murmured. “Stay inside me. Just like this.”
David kissed her temple, voice rough with emotion. “I’m not going anywhere, baby girl.”
They drifted off together on the rug in front of the dying fire—his arms around her, her cheek on his chest, his softening cock still nestled deep inside her, their legs entwined, hearts beating in slow, matched rhythm.
Hours later, the storm had quieted to a soft drizzle. The fire had burned down to glowing embers, casting a faint red-orange glow across their bodies. Moonlight slipped through the windows now, silver and cool, painting pale stripes over their skin.
Kelly stirred first, feeling him still half-hard inside her, the gentle throb of renewed arousal. She clenched experimentally around him. David groaned low in his throat, eyes fluttering open.
“Morning, Daddy,” she whispered, voice sleepy and wicked.
He smiled, slow and predatory. “Not quite morning yet.” His hands slid down her back, cupping her ass, rocking her gently against him. “But I’m wide awake now.”
She lifted her head, kissing him deeply—lazy, morning-after kisses that tasted of sleep and lingering sex. When they parted, she sat up slowly, still straddling him, his cock slipping free with a wet sound that made them both shiver.
Kelly turned, presenting her back to him. “Reverse,” she murmured.
David’s hands guided her hips as she settled over him in reverse cowgirl. He watched, mesmerized, as she reached back, spreading herself slightly, then slowly sank down onto him again. The visual was devastating: his thick shaft disappearing into her tight, glistening pussy, her toned ass flexing with each movement, the delicate lips stretched wide around him.
She began to ride—slow rolls at first, then deeper, harder drops. David’s hands roamed: one sliding up her spine, the other tracing the cleft of her ass. When his thumb brushed her tight rear entrance, she gasped, then pushed back against the touch.
“Like that?” he asked, voice dark with hunger.
“Yes,” she breathed. “Gentle… please.”
He kept it light—circling the sensitive ring with the pad of his thumb, pressing just enough to tease without breaching, sending fresh sparks through her. The added sensation made her ride him harder, faster, her moans turning desperate.
After several minutes she shifted again, climbing off and turning to face him. “On my knees,” she said.
David rose behind her as she settled on all fours, ass presented, back arched. He entered her from behind in one smooth thrust—deep, possessive. His hands gripped her hips, pulling her back onto him with each stroke. The angle let him hit places that made her cry out, walls fluttering around him.
He leaned over her, chest to back, one hand sliding beneath to circle her clit while the other teased her rear entrance again—gentle pressure, slick with their combined wetness. Kelly trembled, overwhelmed by the dual sensations.
“Come for me again, baby girl,” he growled against her ear.
She did—shattering around him with a keening cry, walls clamping down in pulsing waves. David followed moments later, burying himself deep and spilling inside her once more, groaning her name like a prayer.
They collapsed together sideways, spooning on the rug. David stayed inside her as long as he could, arms wrapped protectively around her, one hand cupping her breast, the other resting over her smooth mound where they were still joined.
Moonlight washed over them, soft and forgiving.
Kelly turned her head, kissing him softly. “This is just the beginning, isn’t it?”
David tightened his hold, voice rough with promise. “Every day. Every night. Our secret. Our forever.”
They drifted back toward sleep, tangled and sated, the embers in the hearth glowing like the quiet fire that now burned between them—unquenchable, undeniable, theirs alone.
