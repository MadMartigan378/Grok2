Firelight Confessions and Morning Indulgences
The fire had burned low in the hearth, casting a soft, flickering amber across the rug where Kelly, David, and Mandy lay tangled in a warm, satisfied heap. The wine glasses stood empty on the coffee table, the Rioja's rich berry notes still lingering in the air alongside the musky scent of their shared passion. Kelly's head rested on David's chest, her long dark hair spilling like ink over his skin, while Mandy curled against his other side, her petite frame fitting perfectly into the crook of his arm. At five feet tall, she felt delicate next to his muscular build, her medium breasts pressed softly against his ribs, her cute bubble butt nestled against his thigh.
Mandy traced lazy circles on David's abdomen with her fingertip, her green eyes distant for a moment. The afterglow had loosened her tongue, and the story bubbled up unbidden—a memory stirred by the forbidden thrill of what they'd just done.
"You know," Mandy said softly, voice still husky from her cries earlier, "this reminds me of something. Back when I was with Liam… our first time. Or almost first time."
Kelly lifted her head, propping herself on an elbow, fair skin flushed from exertion. "Oh? Spill. We love a good story."
David chuckled low, his strong hand stroking Mandy's auburn waves. "Yeah, let's hear it. What trouble did you two get into?"
Mandy smiled, a mix of nostalgia and mischief in her eyes. She shifted slightly, her small body pressing closer, the heat from the embers mirroring the warmth building in her core as she recalled. "It was right here, in this house. Liam's room, actually. I was eighteen, visiting for the evening. Your mom—Kim—was still around then. They were watching some drama in the living room down the hall. Liam and I got permission to watch TV in his room, but strict rules: door open at all times, no 'hanky panky,' behave like the 'kids' they still saw us as."
Kelly laughed. "Classic. Mom was always the enforcer."
Mandy nodded, her finger trailing lower on David's stomach, brushing the edge of his softening length. "We started innocent enough. Sat on his bed, door cracked, TV on low—some dumb comedy rerun. But the house was quiet except for the show down the hall, and Liam kept stealing glances at me. I was in a skirt—short, flirty, with a button-up blouse. He leaned in for a kiss, just a peck at first. But it heated up fast."
David's interest piqued; he felt a stir below the belt, his hand sliding to cup Mandy's breast, thumb grazing her nipple in slow circles. The texture was plush, the peak hardening under his touch like a ripe berry.
"Go on," Kelly urged, her own hand wandering to Mandy's thigh, fingers tracing light patterns on the smooth skin.
Mandy's breath hitched at the dual touches, but she continued. "We were making out—deep, passionate, tongues exploring. His hands got bold. Slid up my shirt, feeling my breasts through the bra. God, it felt electric back then—first real touches. He unhooked it clumsily, pushed the fabric aside, and rolled my nipple between his fingers. It sent sparks straight between my legs."
Kelly leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Mandy's shoulder, tasting the faint salt of cooled sweat. "Sounds hot. Inexperienced but eager."
"Yeah," Mandy agreed, her voice dropping. "Then his other hand went under my skirt. Felt me through my panties—cotton, simple. I was already wet. He rubbed, tentative at first, then firmer. I took them off myself—slid them down my legs and kicked them under the bed. He fingered me a little—awkward, not knowing the spots yet, but it felt good. Tried going down on me, but we were both clueless. His tongue was everywhere but where I needed it most." David groaned softly, imagining the scene—young Mandy, legs spread on his son's bed, skirt hiked up. His cock began to twitch back to life against Mandy's hip.
Mandy shifted, feeling him. "Then he got on top. Pulled his shorts down just enough, cock out—hard, but we couldn't get the angle right. He poked and prodded, but nothing. So I flipped us—I got on top, straddling him. His cock sticking straight up, flushed and ready. I guided it, found the spot, and started lowering myself. Bouncing a little at first—shallow, teasing. Then deeper. Just as I got him all the way in—stretching me so full, starting to feel that deep, building pleasure—we heard footsteps."
Kelly's eyes widened. "Oh no."
Mandy nodded, her hand now wrapping around David's thickening shaft, stroking slowly. "David—your dad—coming down the hall. We panicked. I yanked my skirt down to cover us, but I was still sitting on Liam's lap, his cock buried deep inside me. The fullness… God, it was torture not to move."
David's breath caught. He remembered that night vaguely now—the interruption, the flushed faces. But hearing it like this…
"I walked in," he supplied, voice gravelly. "Told you two to behave. Mandy's mom was on her way. You looked so innocent—giggling like kids playing a game."
Mandy turned to him, eyes locked. "But as you turned to leave, my shirt had shifted. Breast exposed—nipple peeking out. You stared for a second. I saw it—your shorts. The bulge growing. It looked… massive. I couldn't look away."
David swallowed hard. "I remember now. Shook it off—told myself you were just a kid, even though you were eighteen. Went back to the show, but I was rock hard the rest of the night."
Kelly's hand joined Mandy's on his cock, their fingers interlacing in slow strokes. "That's so hot. What happened after?"
Mandy leaned in, kissing Kelly softly, then turning to whisper against David's neck. "Liam jerked off that night thinking about how close we got. Me? I touched myself imagining you— that huge bulge, how it would feel stretching me, deep and commanding."
The confession hung in the air, thick with tension. Kelly's free hand slid between Mandy's thighs, finding her slick again. "Well," Kelly murmured, "now you get to find out."
David pulled them both closer. "Bed. Now."
They stumbled upstairs, wine-fueled giggles turning to heated kisses in the hallway. In the master bedroom—David's room—the king bed waited, sheets rumpled from earlier. The girls were tipsy, cheeks rosy; David buzzed from the story and the sight of them.
Mandy pushed him onto the bed, small hands on his chest. "Lie back, Daddy." The word slipped out naturally now, borrowed from Kelly.
Kelly stripped Mandy first—peeling off her remaining clothes, admiring the petite curves: breasts full and perky, nipples like dark cherries, bubble butt begging to be squeezed. Then Kelly shed her own, standing tall and toned beside Mandy's diminutive form.
They knelt between David's legs, taking turns on his cock—Kelly licking the shaft in long, flat strokes, tasting the salty bead at the tip, while Mandy sucked the head, her small mouth stretching around him. The contrast was erotic: Kelly's confident deep-throats versus Mandy's eager, shallower bobs, tongue swirling with surprising skill.
David watched, transfixed—their heads bobbing, auburn and dark hair mingling, soft slurps and moans filling the room.
Kelly climbed onto him first, sinking down with a sigh, her warmth enclosing him in a firm embrace. Mandy straddled his thigh, grinding her slick heat against the muscle while kissing Kelly deeply. They switched—Mandy now riding him, her tight channel gripping like a glove, so snug he had to hold back. She bounced tentatively at first, then bolder, breasts jiggling with each drop. Kelly knelt beside, fingers circling Mandy's clit, then leaning in to suck one nipple.
David flipped them, taking Kelly from behind while Mandy lay beneath, licking where they joined—tongue darting between Kelly's folds and David's thrusting shaft.
The night blurred into a symphony of positions: David on his back with Mandy on his face, her petite ass smothering him deliciously as he tongued her, while Kelly rode him reverse, her toned back arching. Then Mandy bent over the bed's edge, David entering her from behind—slow, deep rolls that made her cry out, his hands kneading her bubble butt.
They came multiple times—Mandy's climaxes sharp and quivering, Kelly's deeper waves, David's releases hot and claiming. Finally, exhausted, they collapsed in a pile—David in the middle, girls on either side, limbs entwined. Sleep came heavy, scented with sex and wine.
Morning light filtered through the curtains, birds chirping outside. David woke to soft sensations: two mouths on his cock. Kelly at the base, licking broad stripes up the shaft, tasting the faint remnants of last night. Mandy at the head, small lips wrapped around, sucking gently, her tongue flicking the underside.
He groaned awake, hands reaching down to stroke their hair. "Good morning, girls."
They didn't stop—working in tandem, passing him between mouths, until he was fully hard, pulsing. Mandy climbed on first, facing him, sinking down with a gasp at the morning stretch. Kelly straddled his face, lowering her warmth onto his tongue—he lapped at her eagerly, tasting her fresh arousal, salty-sweet like morning dew.
Mandy rode him steadily, hips rolling in tight circles, her small size letting her take him deep without effort. The bed creaked softly; sunlight played across their bodies. Kelly ground against his mouth, fingers pinching her own nipples, then leaning forward to kiss Mandy—deep, open-mouthed, sharing moans.
David's hands gripped Kelly's thighs, tongue delving deeper, while his hips thrust up into Mandy. She came first—body tensing, a high keen as her channel rippled around him. The vibration pushed Kelly over—flooding his mouth with her release. David followed, surging up into Mandy, filling her with warm pulses.
They lounged in bed a while after, lazy kisses and touches, before hunger drove them downstairs.
Breakfast was simple—coffee, toast, fruit on the kitchen table. But midway through, Mandy set her mug down, eyes sparkling. "I'm not done yet."
She pulled David to the living room sofa, pushing him to sit. Straddling his lap, she ground against him through clothes until he was hard again. Kelly watched from the armchair, sipping coffee, fingers slipping between her own legs.
Mandy stripped them both, then sank down—reverse this time, facing Kelly, her bubble butt bouncing as she rode. David's hands spread her cheeks, thumb teasing her rear entrance lightly, circling the sensitive skin until she whimpered.
Kelly joined, kneeling between their legs, licking where they joined—Mandy's clit, David's balls, the slick slide of his cock. The sofa creaked; morning light flooded the room, highlighting every flush and glisten.
Mandy climaxed with a shudder, leaning back against David's chest. He flipped her gently, taking her missionary on the cushions—deep, loving strokes while Kelly kissed her neck, sucked her breasts.
They peaked together—David's release deep inside, Mandy's nails scratching his back, Kelly's fingers bringing herself to join. The day unfolded in waves of indulgence. After a lazy shower—three bodies under the spray, soapy hands exploring, David taking Kelly against the tiles while Mandy knelt to lick them both—they dressed lightly and headed to the garden for fresh air. On the old bench under the oak tree, hidden from neighbors, Mandy bent over David's lap for a playful spanking that turned serious—his fingers dipping between her legs, then entering her from behind while Kelly kept watch, her own hand under her skirt.
Lunch was interrupted in the kitchen—Mandy perched on the counter, legs spread, David feasting on her while Kelly fed her bites of sandwich, kisses tasting of mustard and desire.
Afternoon brought a hike in the nearby woods—secluded spot by a stream where they spread a blanket. Kelly and Mandy in 69, David joining by taking Mandy from behind, the rush of water masking their cries.
Evening found them back by the fire—slow, tender lovemaking: David on his back, girls taking turns riding him, then together, kissing above him as he pleasured them both with hands and mouth.
By nightfall, exhausted and bonded, they collapsed into bed again—whispers of future visits, shared secrets, and the thrill of their tangled love.
