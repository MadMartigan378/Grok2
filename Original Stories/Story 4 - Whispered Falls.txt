Whispered Falls
The Welsh forest was alive with late-summer hush as David and Kelly hiked the narrow trail, sunlight filtering through the dense canopy in golden shafts. The air smelled of damp moss, pine resin, and the faint mineral tang of water nearby. Birds called softly overhead; the path wound uphill, roots twisting like ancient veins underfoot. Kelly led, her athletic runner's legs carrying her effortlessly in black leggings and a fitted tank top, long dark hair tied in a loose ponytail that swayed with each step. David followed close behind, backpack slung over broad shoulders, eyes tracing the sway of her hips, the toned curve of her calves. At forty-eight, he still moved with easy power; at twenty-four, she was pure vitality.
They'd packed light—a blanket, water, snacks, and the unspoken promise of privacy. Since that stormy night by the fire, their secret had deepened into a constant, electric hum. Every glance, every brush of fingers, carried the weight of what they'd become.
The trail opened to a hidden glen: a small waterfall cascading over moss-covered rocks into a deep, clear pool. Mist rose from the base, rainbows flickering in the spray. Ferns and wildflowers edged the water; a massive fallen oak lay half-submerged nearby, bark smoothed by time and weather. The roar of the falls was constant but soothing, masking any sound they might make.
Kelly stopped at the edge, turning to him with a wicked smile. "Perfect, right?"
David dropped the pack, stepping close. "More than perfect." He cupped her face, thumbs tracing her cheekbones, and kissed her—slow at first, then deeper, tongues meeting in that familiar, hungry dance. She tasted of the mint gum she'd chewed on the trail and the faint salt of exertion. Her hands slid under his t-shirt, palms flat against the warm, hard planes of his chest.
They sank to the blanket he'd spread on the soft grass. Kisses turned feverish; clothes came off in layers. Tank top over her head—breasts spilling free, nipples tightening in the cool mist. Leggings peeled down her legs, revealing the smooth, waxed mound and delicate pink lips already glistening. David groaned at the sight, fingers tracing her raised mound, parting the small lips to feel her slick heat.
Kelly pushed him onto his back, straddling his hips. She ground against his growing erection through his shorts, coating the fabric with her wetness. "I need you, Daddy," she whispered, voice husky over the falls.
He flipped her gently, laying her on the blanket. Mouth on her breasts—sucking one nipple, rolling the other between calloused fingers. Then lower: tongue tracing her stomach, dipping into her navel, finally settling between her thighs. He devoured her slowly—long licks along her slit, tongue circling her clit, dipping inside to taste her tangy sweetness. Kelly's hands fisted in his hair; her moans blended with the water's roar.
When she was trembling on the edge, he rose, shedding his clothes. Cock thick and hard, veins prominent, pre-cum beading at the tip. Kelly turned, crawling to the fallen tree, bending over it—ass presented, legs spread, hands braced on the smooth bark.
David stepped behind her, hands roaming her back, then cupping her ass. He rubbed his cock along her slit, coating himself in her arousal, teasing her clit with the head. She whimpered, pushing back. "Please… fuck me."
He entered her in one slow thrust—feeling her warmth envelop him, tight walls gripping like velvet. The angle was deep; she gasped at the stretch. He began to move—steady, powerful strokes, hands on her hips pulling her back onto him. Wet sounds of their joining echoed softly under the falls.
His thumb circled her tight rear entrance, slick with her juices. "This okay, baby girl?"
"Yes," she breathed. "Gentle… please." He pressed lightly—circling, teasing the ring without breaching, adding sparks of sensation that made her clench harder around his cock. Kelly moaned louder, pushing back, lost in the dual pleasure.
He took her harder, faster—skin slapping, her breasts swaying with each thrust. When she came, walls pulsing, milking him, he followed—groaning as he spilled deep inside her, hot pulses filling her completely.
They stayed connected for long moments, breathing hard. Then Kelly turned, dropping to her knees on the blanket. She took him into her mouth—tongue swirling around the sensitive head, tasting their combined flavors. She sucked deeper, hollowing her cheeks, sliding down until he hit the back of her throat. David groaned, hand gentle in her hair. She bobbed, taking him fully, throat relaxing as she swallowed around him. When he warned her, she only hummed, urging him on.
He came with a low growl—hot spurts down her throat. Kelly swallowed every drop, milking him until he shuddered, spent.
They collapsed laughing softly, tangled on the blanket. After a few minutes, Kelly stood, pulling him up. "Swim?"
Naked, they waded into the pool. The water was shockingly cold—icy mountain runoff that made them gasp. Kelly dove under, surfacing with a squeal, nipples pebbled tight. David pulled her close, bodies pressing in the chill. The cold shocked his system, but her warmth against him stirred him again—cock twitching despite the temperature.
They splashed playfully, kissing under the spray, then climbed out shivering, wrapping in the blanket to warm up in the sun.
The hike back was slower, hands linked, stealing kisses along the trail. By the time they reached the cottage, the sun was low, and they were sticky with sweat, forest, and lingering sex.
Inside, David turned on the shower—hot water steaming the bathroom. They stepped under together, soap slicking their skin. Kelly pressed against him, soaping his chest, then lower, stroking him back to hardness.
He lifted her against the tiles—legs wrapping around his waist. He entered her slowly, the hot water cascading over them, contrasting the cold pool. Thrusts deep and steady, her back against the warm wall, breasts pressed to his chest. Steam filled the air; water sluiced between them.
Kelly came first—clenching around him, crying out into his shoulder. David followed, spilling inside her again with a guttural moan.
They stayed like that, foreheads touching, water running over them, until the heat began to fade.
Wrapped in towels later, on the couch, Kelly curled into his side. "Best hike ever."
David kissed her temple. "Many more to come, baby girl."
Their secret world grew richer with every stolen moment.
