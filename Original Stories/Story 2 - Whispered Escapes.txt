Whispered Escapes
The morning after the storm dawned crisp and clear over the Welsh hills, sunlight filtering through the curtains of the old stone cottage like a gentle promise. Kelly stirred in her bed upstairs, her body still humming with the echoes of the night before—the way her father's strong hands had mapped her skin, the forbidden heat of him inside her. At 24, she should have felt guilt, but instead, a thrilling secret bloomed in her chest. He's mine now, she thought, stretching languidly, feeling the faint soreness between her thighs. Downstairs, the scent of fresh coffee wafted up, pulling her from the sheets. She slipped into a loose tank top and shorts, her long dark hair tousled, and padded barefoot to the kitchen.
David stood at the counter, his muscular frame clad in a simple t-shirt and jeans, the salt-and-pepper hair catching the light. At 48, he moved with the quiet confidence of a man who'd built his life with his hands, but today there was a softness in his eyes as he turned to her. The memory of her smooth, waxed mound under his fingers, the taste of her on his tongue—sweet and musky, like ripe fruit—lingered in his mind. He poured her a mug, his voice steady but laced with that dominant warmth. "Morning, love. Sleep well?"
Kelly's heart skipped as she took the cup, her fingers brushing his deliberately. From her perspective, the kitchen felt charged, every glance a spark. Does he regret it? Or does he want more, like I do? She leaned against the counter, her athletic build—trim and toned from runs—on subtle display, her 36B bust pressing lightly against the thin fabric. "Like a baby, Daddy," she replied, her tone playful, testing. The word 'Daddy' hung between them, now loaded with seduction.
He set his mug down, stepping closer, his protective instincts mingling with desire. "About last night..." he began, but she silenced him with a finger to his lips, her fair skin flushing with a light tan glow.
"It was perfect," she whispered, her eyes locking on his. "And I want more. Secret. Just us." The thrill of the taboo sent a shiver through her, her nipples hardening under the tank top.
David's hand cupped her cheek, thumb tracing her jaw. "God, Kelly, you're everything." He pulled her into a kiss—slow, deepening, his tongue exploring her mouth with loving possession. She melted against him, her hands roaming his broad back, feeling the muscles shift.
But the world intruded—a knock at the door from a neighbor checking on storm damage. They parted breathlessly, Kelly's thoughts racing: Close call. But that makes it hotter. She smoothed her hair, flashing him a wicked smile before answering the door. The interruption only fueled the fire, turning the day into a game of stolen glances and brushes—his hand grazing her ass as she passed in the hallway, her foot teasing his under the lunch table.
By afternoon, the tension was unbearable. Kelly suggested a hike on the nearby trails, a favorite escape where the Welsh landscape unfolded in green valleys and misty woods. "Fresh air will do us good," she said innocently, but her eyes promised more. David agreed, packing a backpack with water and snacks, his mind already wandering to the privacy of the paths.
They set out under the clear sky, the air crisp with the scent of pine and earth. Kelly led the way, her runner's legs carrying her effortlessly up the incline, shorts hugging her toned thighs. From behind, David admired the sway of her hips, the cascade of her dark hair. She's so alive, so mine, he thought, his arousal stirring.
Halfway up, they veered off the main trail onto a secluded path Kelly knew—a hidden glen with a small stream, surrounded by dense ferns and ancient oaks. The spot was theirs, untouched. Kelly stopped by the water, bending to splash her face, her tank top riding up to
reveal the dimples of her lower back. "It's hot out here," she complained playfully, turning to him with water droplets glistening on her skin.
David dropped the backpack, stepping close. "Let me help." His strong hands settled on her shoulders, massaging lightly at first, thumbs digging into the muscles as he had the night before. But this was different—outdoors, the risk of discovery adding an edge. Kelly moaned softly, leaning back into him, feeling his growing erection press against her ass.
"Feels good, Daddy," she murmured, her voice breathy. She guided his hands lower, under her tank top, to cup her breasts. He obliged, feeling their weight in his palms—firm yet soft, the natural heft shifting as he squeezed gently. Her nipples were hard pebbles under his thumbs, and he rolled them, drawing a gasp from her. The sensation was exquisite: warm skin, responsive to his touch, her body arching for more.
Kelly's thoughts swirled with desire: Out here? Anyone could come by. But I don't care. She turned in his arms, pulling him down for a kiss, her tongue dancing with his. They sank to the soft moss by the stream, the sound of trickling water masking their breaths.
David peeled off her tank top, exposing her breasts to the cool air. He lowered his head, taking a nipple into his mouth, sucking with a rhythm that made her hips buck. The taste of her skin—salty from the hike, mixed with her vanilla perfume—was addictive. His hand trailed down, slipping into her shorts, fingers finding her smooth, waxed mound. It was raised slightly, a soft swell that begged exploration, leading to her small, delicate lips—already slick with arousal.
From his perspective, touching her there was heaven: the mound silky under his palm, the lips petite and flushed, parting easily to reveal her wet core. He traced them slowly, feeling the warmth radiate, her scent rising—musky, feminine, intoxicating. "So perfect," he growled, inhaling deeply before dipping a finger inside, feeling her tightness clench around him.
Kelly whimpered, her legs spreading wider. His fingers know me already. "More, please," she begged. He added another finger, curling them to hit that spot, his thumb circling her clit. The buildup was slow, sensual—waves of pleasure building as the stream babbled nearby.
But she wanted to taste him too. Pushing him onto his back, she tugged at his jeans, freeing his thick cock. It stood proud, veined and hard, pre-cum glistening. She stroked it, feeling the heat, then leaned down, her tongue flicking the tip before taking him deep. David groaned, his hand in her hair, guiding gently as she bobbed, her mouth warm and eager.
He pulled her up before he finished, flipping her onto her hands and knees on the moss. "I need you now," he said, his voice dominant. Positioning behind her, he rubbed his tip along her delicate lips, coating himself in her wetness. The first penetration was deliberate—slow, inch by inch, her warmth enveloping him like velvet, her tightness gripping so intensely it made him shudder. She's so hot, so snug, he thought, savoring the slide.
Kelly cried out softly, pushing back to take him fully. Filling me completely... out here, our secret. He thrust deeply, hands on her hips, the angle allowing him to hit deep. She met his rhythm, her breasts swaying with each movement, nipples brushing the moss.
They switched—her on top, riding him with abandon, grinding down as he cupped her breasts, feeling their weight bounce in his hands. Then back to missionary by the stream, his body covering hers protectively, thrusts slow and loving.
As climax neared, Kelly whispered, "Come inside me, Daddy. Make me yours." The breeding talk ignited him, and with a deep groan, he released, pulsing hotly within her. Her orgasm followed, walls clenching around him, milking every drop.
Spent, she collapsed onto her stomach on the moss, and David moved down with her, still buried deep inside, his weight pressing her gently as he spooned her from above. The connection lingered, his cock softening but not withdrawing, their bodies fused in the afterglow. He kissed her neck, whispering, "I love this—us, hidden away."
Kelly smiled, her thoughts content: More secrets to come. They lay there, listening to the woods, before dressing and heading back, the hike now a cherished memory.
That evening, back home, the secrecy fueled another encounter. Dinner was simple—pasta by candlelight, the storm's remnants leaving a cozy dimness. Kelly wore a sundress, the fabric light and teasing, her long hair loose. David couldn't stop staring, his mind replaying the glen: her delicate pussy gripping him, the taste lingering.
After dishes, she cornered him in the hallway, pressing against him. "Can't stop thinking about today," she confessed, her hand sliding down to palm his erection.
"Neither can I," he admitted, lifting her dress to find her bare underneath—smooth mound waiting. He dropped to his knees right there, in the shadowed hall, his tongue tracing her small lips, delving into her folds. The taste was richer now, mixed with the day's exertions—tangy, sweet, her arousal flowing as he sucked her clit.
Kelly leaned against the wall, legs trembling, her thoughts ecstatic: Anyone could knock, but that's the thrill. She came quickly, muffling her cry in her hand.
Upstairs in his bedroom—their new sanctuary—he laid her on the bed, undressing slowly. She watched, admiring his muscular form, then pulled him down. His hands explored her breasts again, feeling the weight, tweaking the hard nipples until she squirmed.
He entered her missionary-style, the first thrust eliciting a shared moan—her warmth tight and welcoming, hugging him perfectly. They moved with passion, switching to her on top, then doggy on the edge of the bed. As she climaxed again, collapsing forward, he followed, staying deep inside, his body covering hers in a protective embrace.
In the quiet, they cuddled, whispering plans: a weekend trip to a remote cabin, more hikes, stolen moments at home. "Our secret world," David murmured, his hand on her mound.
Kelly nodded, drifting to sleep in his arms. This is just the beginning.
The next day brought another layer—a quick encounter in the garage before her run. David was tinkering with tools when she entered, sports bra and shorts hugging her curves. "Quick massage?" she teased.
It turned into more: his fingers slipping inside her shorts, fingering her delicate pussy until she was dripping, then bending her over the workbench. The penetration was swift, intense—her tightness milking him as he thrust, the scent of oil and her arousal mixing.
They came together, collapsing in a heap, laughing softly at the risk.
Over the week, the encounters multiplied: a late-night bath where he washed her, his hands lingering on her breasts and mound, leading to oral pleasures in the tub; a picnic in a secluded field, ending with her riding him under the sun.
Each time, the buildup was sensual—stolen touches, whispered 'Daddy's, emotional confessions deepening their bond. The taboo thrilled them, but the love anchored it.
By week's end, in bed again, David held her close after another passionate session. "I never want this to end," he said.
"It won't," Kelly promised, her thoughts filled with future secrets. Their world, forbidden and perfect.
