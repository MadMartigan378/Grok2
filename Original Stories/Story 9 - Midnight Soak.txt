Midnight Soak
The Welsh cottage settled into a profound hush as midnight crept in, the kind of silence only rural nights could weave—broken sporadically by the distant hoot of an owl or the faint rustle of wind through the hedgerows outside. Upstairs, the bathroom glowed with the soft flicker of vanilla-scented candles Kelly had arranged along the windowsill, their flames dancing shadows across the white-tiled walls and the steam rising from the clawfoot tub. The air hung heavy with humidity, laced with the herbal bite of lavender bath salts she'd sprinkled in, mingling with the earthy undertone of the old stone house itself. David had drawn the bath earlier, insisting on it after Kelly complained of lingering stiffness from her evening trail run, her muscles protesting the hilly terrain with a dull throb.
Kelly slipped into the room first, her long dark hair loose and still slightly damp from the quick rinse she'd taken downstairs. At twenty-four, her athletic frame moved with a fluid grace, the candlelight tracing golden highlights along her fair skin, lightly freckled from summer sun. She peeled off her robe, letting it pool at her feet, revealing the smooth, toned lines of her body—high, firm breasts with pale pink tips already pebbling in the steamy air, a narrow waist flaring to runner's hips, and below, the raised, silky mound of her pubic area, fully waxed and inviting in its delicate vulnerability. The small lips there were flushed a subtle rose, hinting at the warmth building within from the mere anticipation of sharing this space with him.
She stepped into the tub, sighing as the hot water enveloped her calves, then thighs, the liquid heat seeping into her pores like a lover's caress. Bubbles clung to her skin in frothy clusters, popping softly with tiny bursts that echoed in the enclosed room. "Daddy?" she called out softly, her voice a playful lilt carrying down the hall. "The water's perfect. Don't make me soak alone."
David appeared in the doorway moments later, his muscular silhouette filling the frame. At forty-eight, he exuded a quiet strength, his salt-and-pepper hair cropped short, broad shoulders tapering to a solid chest dusted with dark hair that trailed down to his abdomen. He wore only loose sweatpants, the fabric tenting slightly at the front from the thoughts that had plagued him since she'd suggested this. His calloused hands—rough from years of fixing fences and tending the garden—flexed at his sides as he took in the sight of her, reclined in the tub with water lapping just below her breasts, steam curling around her like a veil. The scent hit him next: her vanilla-musk perfume sharpened by the lavender, a heady mix that stirred memories of their first stormy night together.
"Couldn't resist that voice of yours," he murmured, voice gravelly with restraint. He stepped closer, shedding his pants in one fluid motion, his cock springing free—thick and half-hard, veins tracing its length like rivers on a map, the head already glistening with a bead of clear fluid. Kelly's hazel eyes darkened as she watched him, biting her lower lip, the gesture sending a jolt straight to his core.
He eased into the tub behind her, the water sloshing with a gentle splash as his legs slid along either side of hers. She leaned back against his chest, her head nestling into the crook of his shoulder, feeling the steady thrum of his heartbeat against her back. His arms encircled her, large hands splaying across her stomach, thumbs tracing lazy patterns over the taut skin there. The water's warmth amplified every touch, making her skin hypersensitive, each brush of his fingers sending tingles radiating outward. "You've been tense all day, baby girl," he whispered, breath hot against her ear, carrying the faint, clean taste of mint from his earlier tea. "Let me ease it out of you."
Kelly arched slightly into his hold, a soft hum escaping her throat as his hands ventured upward. He cupped her breasts gently, feeling their supple weight settle into his palms, the peaks hardening under his thumbs like awakening buds. The texture was plush, yielding yet resilient, and he rolled them between rough pads, drawing out a breathy gasp from her. The sound reverberated off the tiles, intimate and raw, blending with the occasional drip from the faucet. She tasted salt on her lips as she licked them, the humidity pulling faint perspiration to the surface.
"Mmm, right there," she breathed, her hand reaching back to tangle in his hair, nails scraping lightly against his scalp. The steam thickened the air, carrying the mingled scents of their bodies—his musky, masculine essence blending with her sweeter arousal, a tangy undercurrent that grew as heat pooled between her legs.
David's touch grew bolder, one hand sliding down her abdomen, fingers dipping below the waterline to trace the smooth rise of her mound. The skin there was impossibly soft, like warmed silk, and he parted her small lips with deliberate care, feeling the slick warmth that greeted him—hotter than the bath itself, a viscous nectar coating his fingertips. She whimpered, hips shifting subtly, the motion causing water to lap against the tub's sides with rhythmic sloshes. He circled her clit slowly, the nub swelling under his touch, sending sparks through her nerves that made her toes curl against the porcelain.
"You're so responsive tonight," he growled low, nipping at her earlobe, tasting the faint salt of her skin. His other hand continued kneading her breast, pinching the tip just enough to elicit a sharper moan. Below, he delved deeper, a finger slipping into her core—the channel gripping him with a pulsing heat, walls fluttering like a captured flame. The wet sounds were muffled by the water but unmistakable: a subtle schlick as he moved, her arousal mixing with the bath to create a slippery glide.
Kelly twisted her head to capture his lips, the kiss starting soft but igniting quickly—tongues tangling in a dance that tasted of shared breath and lingering lavender. She ground back against him, feeling his hardness press insistently against her lower back, the rigid length throbbing with need. "I want you inside me, Daddy," she whispered against his mouth, voice husky, the words sending a shiver down his spine. "Fill me up... make me yours completely."
His internal conflict flickered briefly— the forbidden thrill of it all, this deep love twisted with desire—but consent shone in her eyes, trust radiating like the candlelight. He shifted them carefully, water cascading over the edges in small waves as she turned to face him, straddling his hips. Her breasts hovered just above the surface, bubbles clinging to the undersides, and she reached down, wrapping her fingers around his cock. The grip was firm, stroking once, twice, feeling the veins pulse under her palm, the head flaring with each pass. Pre-cum mixed with the water, adding a silky sheen.
Positioning him at her entrance, she lowered slowly, the initial breach drawing synchronized groans—the stretch exquisite, her inner muscles yielding in waves to accommodate his girth. It wasn't the familiar velvet clasp; tonight, the heat felt like molten silk enveloping him, drawing him deeper with each inch until he was seated fully, their bodies locked in a wet, intimate union. The water amplified the sensations, buoyancy making her movements lighter, more fluid as she began to rock.
David's hands gripped her hips, guiding her rhythm—slow at first, building to a steady cadence. Each upward thrust sent water splashing softly, the sounds joining her gasps and his throaty rumbles. He watched where they connected, mesmerized by the way her delicate lips parted around him, clinging with each withdrawal, the flushed pink contrasting the bubbles. The scent of their joining rose stronger now, tangy and primal, overpowering the lavender.
"Fuck, baby... you're gripping me so tight," he rasped, one hand sliding up to cup her face, thumb tracing her parted lips. She sucked it in, tongue swirling around the digit, tasting the faint bitterness of bath salts mixed with his skin. Her pace quickened, breasts bouncing with each descent, nipples grazing his chest in electric brushes that made her core clench harder.
As climax built, she leaned forward, forehead against his, breaths mingling in hot puffs. "Come inside me, Daddy... breed me, make it real," she pleaded, the words a seductive mantra born of their passion, no force behind them but pure want. He thrust up to meet her, the angle hitting deep, pressure coiling until she shattered—body quaking, walls rippling in fervent waves around him, a gush of warmth flooding their join. The sensation tipped him over, his release surging in thick pulses, filling her with heat that leaked back into the water as aftershocks trembled through them.
They collapsed together, still connected, her head on his shoulder as the water settled. His arms wrapped around her, fingers tracing soothing paths down her back, the touch tender now. "I love you more every time," he murmured, kissing her temple, tasting the cooled sweat there. "We'll keep this ours... forever."
In the quiet afterglow, they lingered, planning whispers of future escapes—a cabin getaway, perhaps—while the candles burned low, casting their secret in flickering gold.
